    "content": "**500 Word Limit**\n\nAll stories must be 500 words or less. A story that is 501 words (or two sentences or less, to distinguish us from r/twosentencehorror) will be removed. The go-to source that mods use to check stories is www.wordcounter.net. Be aware that formatting can artificially increase the word count without your knowledge; any discrepancy between what your document says and what the mod sees on wordcounter.net will be resolved in favor of wordcounter.net. In the same vein, all of the story must be in the post itself, and not be carried on in the title of the story or in the comment section.\n___________________\n\n**All titles must be 6 words or less**\n\nIn effort to curb clickbait/summarizing titles, titles are now subject to a word count limit. Titles must be 6 words or less, and can be no more than a single sentence.\n\n____________\n\n**No Links Within the Story Itself** \n\nStories **cannot** have links in them. This is meant to reduce distractions. Any story with a link in it will be removed.\n___________________\n**Promotional Links in the Comment Section**\n\nSelf-Promotion can only be done in the comment section of the story. Authors may **only** link to personal subreddits. Links to sales sites such as Amazon or posts with the intent of generating sales are **strictly forbidden.** We **no longer allow** links to outsides websites like blogs, author websites, or anything else. \n\n___________________\n**No Tags in the Title**\n\nThere is no need to add tags to a post. This includes disclaimers, explanations, or any other commentary deemed unnecessary. Stories with tags will be removed and re-submissions will be required. We do not require trigger warnings here as other rules cover subject matters which may be harmful to readers. Additionally, emojis and other non-text items are not allowed in the title.\n___________________\n**Non-Story Text Within the Story** \n\nJust post the story. That's all we want. We don't need commentary about it being your first story, what inspired you, disclaimers telling the audience this is a true story, \"THE END\" at the end, repeating the title, the author name. Anything supplemental can be posted in the comment section. \n___________________\n**Stand Alone Stories Only** \n\nNo multi-part stories, no sequels, prequels, interquels, alternative viewpoint stories, links to previous stories for reference, or reoccurring characters. Anything that builds off of or depends on some other story you’ve written is off-limits. This extends to titles overtly or implying stories are connected to one another. Fan fiction is not allowed, this includes using characters from other works of fiction under copyright. The story begins and ends within the 500 words or less you are allotted. \n\n___________________\n**All Stories Must Be Horror and/or Thriller Themed** \n\nWe ask that authors focus on creating stories within horror and thriller stories. You may borrow from other genres, but the main focus of the story **MUST** be to horrify, scare, or unsettle. Stories with jokey punchline will be removed. We shouldn't be laughing at the end of the story. Stories dealing with depression, suicide, mental illness, medical ailments, and other assorted topics belong over on /r/ShortSadStories. However, this doesn't mean you cannot use these topics in your stories. There's a delicate balance between something horrifying and sad. If we can interpret the story as being scary, we will do so. \n\nPlease note that badly written stories, don't necessarily fall under this category. The story can be terrible, but still be focused on horror. \n\n___________________\n**No Plagiarism** \n\nAll stories must be an original work. Stories written by AI are not allowed. Stories must be submitted by the authors who wrote the story. Do not steal other users' stories. No fan-fiction allowed. Reposts of previously submitted stories are not allowed.\n\nRepeat offenses will result in a ban. If someone can find your story somewhere else, it will be removed. This rule also applies to famous or common stories that you’ve merely reworded slightly. This does not apply to famous stories you’ve reworked considerably, such as a fresh take on a fairytale or urban legend. The rule of thumb is that the more you alter the text to make the story your own, the more lenient we’ll be.\n___________________\n**Rape/Pedophilia/Bestiality/Torture Porn/Gore Porn are Off-Limit Topics**\n\nThe intent of this ban is to prevent bad actors from exploiting this sub as a delivery system for their fantasies, which would bring the tone down, and alienate the reader base who don’t want to be exposed to such material. We acknowledge that this ban throws out the baby with the bath water, as well-made stories that merely happen to have such themes will get removed as well. But if we let in the decent stories with such content, those bad actors can point at them and demand to know why those stories get to stay and not theirs. Better by far to head the issue off entirely with a hard ban and stick to it.\n\nStories *implying* rape or pedophilia will also be removed. \n_______________\n\n**The Moratorium**\n\nTrends are common on creative writing subreddits. In an effort to curb trends from taking over the subreddit, we are implementing The Moratorium. This is a temporary three month ban on certain trends which the mods have examined and determined are dominant within the subreddit. Which violate the Moratorium will be removed. \n\n___________________\n**24 Hour Rule**\n\nAuthors must wait 24 hours between submissions. If your story is removed due to a rule break, you are still subject to the 24 hour rule. Deleting a post **does not** release the author from the 24 hour rule. Deleting a post and posting something different also **does not** release the author from the 24 hour rule. This is to prevent authors gaming the algorithm system, doing interest checks, or posting until their story is deemed \"successful.\"\n\nExceptions can be made if the Moderators are contacted **before** resubmission, and only if it is deemed necessary. For example, we'll allow a repost if there's an error in the title with no penalty. \n\n___________________\n**Exceptionally Poor Quality Stories May Be Removed** \n\nWe reserve the right to remove any story that fails to use proper grammar, has frequent typos, or is in general just a poorly composed story. This is relative, and we will use that right as sparingly as possible. Walls of text will automatically be removed.\n___________________\n**No Obnoxious Commentary** \n\nThis includes, but is not limited to: bigotry/hate speech, personal insults, exceptionally low quality feedback, antagonistic behavior, use of slurs, etc. Use your best judgement. Mod response will take the form of a spectrum ranging from a mild warning to a permaban, depending on the context. Incidentally, the lowest response we have to mod abuse is banning, because we quite literally don’t need to put up with it.\n\nWe reserve the right to lock any thread that veers off topic into some controversial subject, such as politics or social commentary. This is simply not the venue for it.\n_______________\n**Posts Impersonating Other Subreddits**\n\nPosts impersonating other subreddit posting styles like /r/AITA, /r/Relationships, /r/Advice, are no longer allowed on SSS. If there's overwhelming commentary about subreddit confusion in the comment section, your story will be removed. \n\n________________________\n\n**Links to Author Collectives with Restricted Submissions and/or curated content cannot be advertised on SSS.**\n\nWe've noticed authors posting links to personal subreddits and in the same comment section post a link to a subreddits for an author collective. Normally, these author collectives have restricted submissions and curated content while SSS is free and open to everyone for posting. It seems a bit rather unfair for these author collectives to build their readership off /r/ShortScaryStories. While we wish to allow individual authors to build a readership off their own work, we will no longer allow author collectives with restricted submissions or curated content to advertise on /r/ShortScaryStories.\n________________________\n\n\n\nA few additional notes:\n\nIf you have an issue that you need to address or a question for us, please contact us over modmail. That said, mod decisions are final; badgering or spamming us with messages over and over about the same subject will not change our minds, but it can easily get you banned.\n\nIf you see a story or comment that breaks these rules, please hit the report button. This will help us maintain a tightly focused and enjoyable sub for everyone.\n\nMeta commentary and questions about the sub can be made at /r/ShortScaryStoriesOOC",

    "content": "People in my life thought they could take everything and be done with me.\n\nJenny left me for my best friend after seven years. Didn’t even give me a reason. She just packed a bag and walked out like I wasn’t standing there.\n\nMike, my brother, decided to ignore the six months of calls I'd made to him. I'd covered his overdrafts and fixed all his mistakes while he drank at the bar. Didn’t pay me back, didn't take my calls, and didn't say thanks.\n\nEven the landlord took me for a long ride, increasing the rent every month but never fixing anything.\n\nEverywhere I looked, someone was taking something from me.\n\nLife was pretty miserable. \n\nAnd then... I died.\n\nHeart gave out one night in my sleep. I remember feeling suddenly... *awake.* An eerie silence coated my skin. Then the flood of realisation that I wasn’t quite finished hit me.\n\nAnd I smiled.\n\nJenny was first. She woke up to the smell of my cologne. Said it felt like someone sat on the edge of the bed. She tried to laugh it off, but she didn’t sleep the next night. Or the one after.\n\nMike heard my ringtone, the same one he used to ignore, buzzing from inside his wardrobe. Nothing there, just his sweaty reflection in the mirror behind it.\n\nThe landlord started hearing footsteps and dripping water. Over and over and over. He ripped out pipes, hired multiple plumbers. Still, every night, the sound came back. A steady, mocking drip from nowhere.\n\nI don’t throw things. I don’t shout. I don’t show myself. I just lean in close enough for them to feel it. Breath on the neck. A cold shift in the air. The faintest whisper at the wrong moment. It’s all small. Subtle. The kind of things they can’t quite explain to anyone else without sounding mad.\n\nThey all try to move on, but they can’t.\n\nThat’s the thing about unfinished business... It's always *unfinished.*\n\nI watch them unravel, one by one. Jenny keeps the lights on now. The bags under her eyes could hold a week's shopping. Mike doesn’t answer calls anymore. *Any* call. He just rocks in the corner of his room, occasionally sipping at the small bottle of vodka. And the landlord? Well he's moved apartments more times than the post office could update his address, and yet he still wakes at three a.m. hearing footsteps and a faint dripping sound.\n\nHe screams quite often now.\n\nThey always say you can’t take anything with you when you go...\n\nBut that’s just hilariously not true.",

    "content": "I wrapped a towel on my head after a hot shower as I did every time, only this time it pinched a nerve in the nook of my neck, right where my spine connects to my skull, and a wave of heat shot through me and felt like a blast wave. I had to sit down on the bed, and then had to lay down as I tugged the towel off.\n\nThe sensation was like a muscle cramp, only in my skull. I knew about stroke so thought maybe it was that. But then, I had no sensation of nothingness or falling that I heard those people feel. Instead I just felt blasted.\n\nI got an appointment at the doctor but that was no help, he just blamed my office chair and told me to sit up straight and my occipital ridge would cool off. I get more value out of Doritos from a vending machine, and it's a good amount cheaper than doctor office co-pay. \n\nRambling.\n\nAnyway I got home after the appointment, and I could still feel a hot pulse where the nook was. I felt it. Didn't feel a bump or anything like that. It did feel warm though, like I could feel the blood coursing through the capillaries there. I ended up falling asleep while it was still light out. \n\nWhat woke me was a freezing cold sensation. Reversed from that nooky onset when I pinched whatever nerve with my towel. I was shivering and it was dark out. When I reached behind my head to touch the sensitive spot, there was a gaping hole. I felt around the edges and it felt serrated like a toothy mouth. A tiny toothy mouth, and it seemed to breathe with me, I felt its hot breath on my fingertips. Then I felt something like a little tongue lick my finger and I yanked my hand out and away and I screamed.\n\nI felt the little hole creature matching my anatomical processes of breathing in and out, but I wouldn't dare try touching it again. I rushed into the bathroom and grabbed a hand mirror in front of the big one, trying to see the mini mouth. I put my glasses on to see more clearly. My whole neck was covered in blood and only now did I calm down enough to realize I was drenched in blood, my whole back. I felt a sudden horrible pain, like being cut. I winced but kept looking in the mirrors. The little mouth licked its teeth and spat something out which fell to the floor. I knelt down and retrieved the bloody slimy morsel, and examined it to realize it was grey matter—a bit of my cerebral cortex.\n\nI've begun feeding it store-bought raw meat, and chicken gizzard, liver and heart. It likes those. I don't like the situation but at least it stopped taking bites out of my brain, for now. Not sure what to do next.",

    "content": "I was the vice president of the SGA board at my school. My best friend, Henry, was on the school spirit committee. He had tons of ideas to boost morale, but the president shut him down before they even started. It really bothered him; not being taken seriously, even with my influence, wasn’t enough.\n\nWe always had a meeting Thursday afternoon and another Friday morning before the pep rally. I arrived around 4:30 p.m. for our usual meeting and saw Henry walking up.\n\n“Hey, buddy—ready to spitball some new ideas?” I asked.\n\nHe sighed. “Yeah, I guess so, Jackson. But they never take me seriously.”\n\n“Dude, don’t worry about that,” I said, lowering my voice. “You’ve got great ideas for real change.”\n\nHenry shrugged. “Dude, they make fun of me behind my back all the time—I know it.”\n\nHonestly, that was kind of true. No one really liked Henry or bothered to get to know him.\n\n“Henry, listen—you’ve got to at least try to seem nice. You didn’t even bring snacks for the meeting.”\n\nI reached into my bag and pulled out two dozen cookies. “Here, bring these. My mom made them.”\n\nHenry’s eyes lit up. “Oh snap, your mom makes the best cookies. I’ll test the product before the meeting.”\n\nI scoffed. “They’ve got peanut butter in them. Just make sure to tell the rest of the board.”\n\nHenry laughed quietly. “Tshh, bummer. Appreciate it, Jackson—you’re a real friend.”\n\nThe meeting was a mess. Henry got shut out of most of the conversation and stormed out. I didn’t think much of it—figured he’d cool off by morning. \n\nThat night, I stayed up late, scrolling through articles about what makes an SGA president successful. Then Henry started blowing up the group chat.\n\n*“Fuck all of y’all.”*  \n *“No one listens to me, even when I have the best ideas.”*  \n *“You’ll all regret undermining me.”*\n\nThen he left the chat and started texting me directly.\n\n*“Don’t come to the meeting tomorrow. They’ll all pay.”*\n\nMy heart sank. Henry had been bullied most of his life by the same people in SGA. His threats felt real. I was worried he might do something he’d regret for the rest of his life.\n\nThe next morning, I got to the parking lot early. I knew I had to inform the cops of his location just in case he really went to a deadly extent. Then I saw Henry speed in and park fast. He jumped out with a huge duffel bag.\n\nThe cops intercepted him immediately. Apparently, they were already looking for him.\n\nNow Henry’s on trial. The prosecutors had a ton of questions—like why he showed up to school with water guns filled with piss and the same poison coated cookies in his car he used to kill most of the members of SGA. They charged him with eight counts of murder by poisoning.\n\nWhat a shame.\n\nNow I’m president.  \n He’d be proud to see all his ideas finally being used.",

    "content": "He sprayed the reflective glass of the mirror before him with milk-white fluid, pus violently freed from the purple-black sore he was squeezing on his face. \n\n“Oh…” \n\nA moan like pleasure escaped him. It was always so intense, euphoric, the release. They hurt so much, when one of them finally gave or he burst it open himself, the tidal wave of relief that followed the initial sharp stab of pain was so immense and blissful he wished it would never end. \n\nBut it did. Always. \n\nHe increased his pressure, the last little bit was always the hardest to push out, the thickest gunkiest cheese that was bred in the large infected pores, the holes, the veritable craters of his decimated face. A ruined landscape. He'd been a beautiful child once. \n\nHe pressed harder still, pinching, thumb to thumb, finally the flow of blood. The dead black first, bits and hunks of white throughout its thick flow, then finally the lighter red stuff that more resembled healthy human anatomy. He sighed again, but not from relief this time. \n\nHe stepped back a little from the sink, grabbing a few squares of toilet paper to wipe away the bloody human milk from the mirrors surface. He hated what he saw. He refused to ever leave the confined sanctity of his own home ever again \n\nEyes nearly swollen shut, slitted, just enough to still be able to see and to know the full extent of the damage. Pink, purple, hectic red and rotten black all in a riot of malformation and discoloration, a riot of color amongst a riot of the flesh itself. Eruptions. Ballooned pores and swollen sacs of green that quivered and moved with an animal pulse to the time of his heartbeat. Semi-popped, semi-healed scabbed craters, infected and picked at, jagged with crystalline scarlet and pus like the surface of some demon planet. Sores that were volcanic in their structure and their spew all over the demonic landscape of his awful face. Oozing, always oozing a translucent slime that left trails on his towels and his clothing, trails like that of a garden slug. Crusty, smaller more painful pink pustules tipped with older harder dried secretion the color and shape of orange Cheetos. All of it open pores and oozing discharge and the ever present wafting smell of cheap gas station cheese. \n\nThe whole canvas of his humanity was a ruin. Repulsive. Abhorrent. He was a horror. Foul. Beyond disgusting. The light of day unfiltered, unfettered by a pane of glass would never again touch his face, his skin. His wretched foul riotous flesh. \n\nThere was a rope and many sharp things in the house, he pondered which one he would eventually use.",

    "content": "I am losing my mind here. All I want is a nice wedding, nothing outrageous, everything within reason, no bridezilla demands – and each time we set a date, someone dies. I’m not gonna lie, I first thought his sister Anna has put some sort of hex on us, although now I’ve changed my mind on that. It’s obviously my brother’s wife who was always jealous of me and can never bear not being the centre of attention- just hear me out.\n\nFirst time we were planning a spring wedding for May, and his stupid uncle has a freak accident in the kitchen. I’m not going to bother you with details, but it was his fault and electricity was involved. Ok, I got it, his mom and her brother were super-close, she can’t deal with a wedding right now- I was still trying to get them to know me and like me, and so, very graciously, I think, I agreed to delaying to summer. I even became excited about being a summer bride. I started checking out coastal venues. Mermaid dresses with pearl beads and scales- ftw.  \n\nThen, in June, my MoH’s baby sister drowns in their backyard pool. So fucking weird- why were they letting a five-year-old swim in the pool by herself?  I was actually there when it happened, yes, we were having a wedding planning get-together, you know, lots of cocktails! anyway, the vibes were off, and I didn’t like the idea of a wedding by the water anymore. I’m telling you, I am a considerate bride!\n\nI was happy to start thinking about fall weddings- leaves, orange and shit, we even thought about a Halloween theme, lean into the darkness, right? Lean right in to ghosts and coffins! Even Anna seemed enthusiastic about the idea, and she really warmed up to me, for like the first time since whats-his-name and I got together. She even agreed to be my MoH since my bestie wasn’t really up for it.  We set a November date, and then- well, it’s actually quite sad, my niece died in a car accident.\n\nYes, I get it. I’m sad too, I keep telling them! And I totally understand my brother and his wife are devastated and so are mom and dad, I’m not a monster but, I mean, when is it going to be my turn? Mom suggested we elope or have a small registry wedding, and honestly, how is that fair to me? My family have totally turned against me.\n\nThankfully, Anna is very sympathetic - she’s telling me to go ahead and plan a proper Christmas wedding and she’ll help with all the deets- a proper ice-princess theme, which kind of naturally lends itself to a wedding dress, know what I mean? Elsa’s castle? \n\nI can see her vision, and I’m not hating it. Anna says not to listen to haters, and she’ll deal with my brother and his wife when the time come.",

    "content": "The King’s greatest fear was losing his mind to megalomania. \n\n\n\nHe had reigned for thirty years, and every time he entered a room, subjects fell at his feet begging for an opportunity to kiss the bottom of his purple cloak. \n\n\n\nTo guard against hubris, I was instructed to remind him daily as he awoke, ‘Your Highness, remember, *you are only a man*– memento te mortalem esse.’ \n\n\n\nAnd the King would look at the dawn sun in its chariot blazing across the sky and say, ‘Thank you, ‘tis true.’ \n\n\n\n… \n\n\n\nAs a body servant, I knew him far better than even his Queen, whom he was reluctant to appear naked around. \n\n\n\nI was in tune with his four humours. \n\n\n\nI wiped his nose when it was bloody, cleaned his vomit when he overindulged in wine, disposed of mucus-soiled handkerchiefs, and listened as he vented his spleen while hanging over the chamberpot.  \n\n\n\n… \n\n\n\nOne late night, I was summoned by the Queen.\n\n\n\nThe only blight on the King’s reign was that no heir had been sired, and this had seen two previous Queens dethroned. \n\n\n\nShe spoke with the soft, lilting Spanish accent of her high-born continental ancestors. \n\n\n\n‘How is your health?’ \n\n\n\n‘His health is good and long may it continue.’ \n\n\n\n‘You mistake me. I asked How is *your* health?’ \n\n\n\nI hesitated. ‘Mine, ma’am? You do not have to concern yourself with me.’ \n\n\n\n‘Answer her question, damn it.’ \n\n\n\nThat was Norfolk, one of her courtiers and a powerful voice in the House of Lords. \n\n\n\n‘Well, I am still able to carry out my duties.’ \n\n\n\n‘And you have an estate awaiting you in your dotage?’ \n\n\n\nIt seemed absurd, but Norfolk continued. ‘Yes, you will have an estate.’ \n\n\n\nAnd from there, the talk moved on to the King. \n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\nI opened the curtain; the King stirred. \n\n\n\nUsually, I would assist him with his daily ablutions. This was a process complicated because the King’s nether regions were scarred by syphilis– an area I also treated with makeup on his wedding night. \n\n\n\nTo perform the act of urination, he required the aid of a speculum; other acts were also greatly hampered.  \n\n\n\nI remained quiet, a silhouette to him as the morning sunlight streamed into the room. \n\n\n\n‘Hmm?’ he said, sitting up expectantly on one elbow. \n\n\n\nI took the blanket from him, neatly upturned the edges, remaining tight-lipped. \n\n\n\n‘Well, say it!’ he said. ‘Do your duty.’ \n\n\n\nAnd at that, I plunged the dagger into his breastbone. \n\n\n\nHe took my hands, which were gripped around the blade’s hilt. There was a question in his eyes, dying upon his lips, which I answered in a whisper.\n\n\n\n‘The Queen offers me recompense to testify you are seedless,’ I paused as his body shuddered and blood, which would no longer be my role to clean up, pooled on the sheets. ‘One last time, your Majesty, remember… You are just a man.’",

    "content": "Wind worried the shattered panes of the tower block, carrying the sweet-sour stink of rot up the stairwell. Ellie kept one hand on the rail and the other on the fire axe. “Count the steps,” she whispered. “Don’t look down.”\n\n“Twenty-two to landing,” Jamie said behind her, torch cupped. “Don’t breathe through your mouth.”\n\nThey had waited three months for the siren. When it finally coughed from the ruined tannoy, EVAC CORRIDOR OPEN, Arun said it could be a trap. Mo just smiled and packed the baby formula that wasn’t hers. Down they went.\n\nThe first corpse moved on nineteen.\n\nIts ribs were a wet basket. Fingers slipped along the concrete as it dragged itself, jaw unhinged and grinding like cutlery. Ellie swung. The axe stuck. She stamped the skull until it flattened; grey jelly winked from the sockets. “Sorry,” she said, out of habit.\n\n“Keep going,” Arun told her. “We’ll make the Piccadilly line before dark.”\n\nThey hit the lobby and found it full of them: silhouettes swaying in the blown snow of ash, faces like melting candles. One wore a bridal veil. Another wore a bobble hat with “CHELSEA” crusted in brown. Jamie breathed, “Mum?” and the thing in the hat snapped toward him, teeth chattering like a jar of nails.\n\n“Move,” Ellie said.\n\nThe turnstiles down to the Tube were stuck with filmed blood. They shoved through and took the long escalator on foot, sliding on skin. Somewhere below, a generator grumbled; blue light pulsed like a heartbeat. The smell became chemical, clean and wrong.\n\nAt platform level the gates were open. Signs, bright and almost new, pointed towards DECONTAMINATION, SAFE COMMUNITY, FOOD. A train waited, doors yawning. The carriage interiors were lined in sheeting. Mops. Drains.\n\n“This is… tidy,” Arun said.\n\nMo shuffled ahead, clutching formula. “Maybe they got it sorted,” she said. “Maybe London’s finally clean.”\n\nA figure stepped out from the driver’s cab in a plastic hood and visor. Its voice crackled through a speaker. “Remain calm. Step aboard single file.”\n\nEllie studied the floor. The drains were fat as wrists. The mops were meat-stained. Her axe felt tacky in her palm. “What happened to the last passengers?”\n\n“Processed,” the hooded figure said. “Please board.”\n\n“We’re clean,” Arun called. “We haven’t turned.”\n\n“Not yet.” Another two figures appeared, these with rifles and polehooks. Behind Ellie, the dead crowded the tunnel mouth, a slow black tide. Fingers splayed. Teeth shone.\n\n“Ellie,” Jamie breathed. “We can’t fight both.”\n\nThe speaker hissed. “Please board. The living are needed.”\n\n“For what?” Ellie asked.\n\n“Fuel.” The visored figure’s tone didn’t change. “Z-series do not metabolise bone well. Your calcium augments the slurry.”\n\nArun laughed, high and sudden. “You’re joking.”\n\n“Step aboard,” the voice said, with weary patience, like a bus driver at midnight. “We’ve got schedules.”\n\nEllie took Jamie’s hand and pulled him towards the train.\n\nShe smiled at the dead as they screamed and reached.\n\n“Mind the gap,” she told the zombies, and stepped inside.",

    "content": "I have a gift. An unfortunate one. Or maybe, just maybe, it’s for the greater good. There’s evil in this world which 99% of us truly can’t see. And I’m not speaking about the corrupt politicians, I’m talking about literal demon spawns. I call them red demons. Just like how you’re imagining it now. Around 2 feet tall, brightly red colored bodies, no shirt, brown pants cut off at the bottom with teeth like design. Small, sharp pitchforks. Yellow eyes, giant, front teeth coming out of their mouths. I see them. They’re around us and no one else notices because of this cursed gift I have. Like the boy in Sixth Sense, who saw dead people. For years now, I have been killing off these demons to keep our world pure. And I will continue doing so until my last breath. \n\nThe Jesus stuff…doesn’t work on them. I’ve tried Crosses, Holy Water and bunch of that religious mumbo jumbo. There’s no effect. That shit’s only for the movies. I have to do this the old fashioned way. Take them away in a sack, zip tie it and beat it to death with a hammer while it’s still inside in an abandoned alley. Because if someone sees me kidnapping which they see it as nothing, would cause a juvenile gossip and they’ll try to take me away to an institution or something where my gift will no longer be a help to anyone. \n\nBut it happened, an old lady saw me do this act. Called the police. And now I’m sitting in a cell watching a shitty 13 inch television with the others in a holding cell. Waiting to see what they actually got on me. There’s no way they see what I see. Unless the old lady was also able to see these red demons. \n\nI heard 3-4 officers quickly rush to my holding unit, open the gates, knock me down and put me in handcuffs. I was confused and heartbroken on the way I was being treated. There’s far more evil in this world to be taken care of than falsely assume it’s me. \n\nLike the guy they’re talking about in the news on the tv right now. Saying a man has been identified and is in custody for being a serial killer, kidnapping and killing over 100+ children with a hammer going back 5 years and called red demons.",

    "content": "“What’s that, Grandpa?” From the doorway of his study, I pointed at the furry thing mounted in a glass case on the wall.\n\nMy mom and I moved in with him after my dad died. It was only supposed to be for a couple of months, but that quickly turned into a year, and now it looked like we were going to be staying permanently.\n\n“That right there is my most valued possession,” he replied, “Come here,” he motioned, “I’ll show you.”\n\nI walked into the room and watched as he carefully pulled the display case off the wall and set it on his desk.\n\nThe thing inside was about 2 feet long and bushy like a fox’s tail. Unlike a fox’s tail, or any other animal I’d seen, the hair on it was different shades of blue, starting light on one end and gradually becoming darker until it ended in a black tip.\n\n“Do you believe in fairies?” my grandpa asked.\n\n“Not really,” I replied. I was 8. I stopped believing in things like that by the time I was 6.\n\n“Believe it or not,” he tapped the display case with his fingers, “This is a fairy’s tail.”\n\n“Fairies don’t have tails,” I replied.\n\n“Some don’t,” he agreed, “But around these parts, they do.”\n\n“Where did you get it?”\n\n“The fairy it belonged to gave it to me for saving his life.” He then went on to explain how he saved the fairy from a bear trap.\n\n“But why his tail?” That part of the story didn’t make sense. Why would a fairy cut off its own tail as a reward? That sounded horrible.\n\n“Fairy tails contain a lot of magic,” my grandpa said, “By giving me his tail, he transferred some of that magic to me. It’s what keeps me feeling young and healthy.” When he saw the disgusted way I was looking at the tail, he quickly added, “Don’t worry, their tails grow back.”\n\n“That’s…cool,” I said. But I didn’t really think that. I thought it was kind of lame. At least I did until the next morning, when I remembered I needed to bring something into school for show and tell. I thought some of the other kids might think the tail really was cool, so I hid it in my backpack before I left to catch the bus.\n\nAs soon as I stepped off the porch, I was confronted by a blue-foxlike creature that was missing a tail.\n\n*Maybe my grandpa wasn’t lying.*\n\n“Is this yours?” I asked after pulling the tail out of my backpack.\n\nThe blue fox nodded.\n\nI opened the case and set the tail on the ground in front of the odd creature. It walked up to the tail and then turned around and sat on it. When it got up again, its tail was reconnected.\n\n“You didn’t give him your tail, did you?”\n\nThe fox shook its head and then ran off into the woods.\n\nThat night, my grandpa died.",

    "content": "After Josie died, the house felt wrong in ways her parents couldn’t explain. The air hung heavy, thick with a sour sweetness like rotting fruit. Her mother spent hours scrubbing the floors and walls, trying to erase something invisible. But every time she stepped into Josie's old room, a sick weight pressed in her chest, as if the shadows themselves remembered. Her father tried to fix the peeling wallpaper and the leaks, but the house resisted. Paint bubbled under his fingertips and windows rattled with no wind. Toys moved on their own at night, rolling across the floor in jerky, unnatural ways. Their old dog refused to enter the room, whining at the door like it was a barrier against something hungry.\n\nAt night, the family heard noises they wished they could forget. There were scraping sounds from the vents, soft wet dragging across the floor, and faint humming. It was the same lullaby Josie used to sing. Her brother swore he saw a pale figure in the hallway, just beyond the corner of his eye, vanishing whenever he turned. One evening, her mother found thin strips of skin tucked beneath the bedpost, raw and slick, as if someone had clawed their way out. The house grew colder, and the faintest breath of something foul slipped beneath the doors. The humming sometimes formed words, begging: “Come play with me.”\n\nThe longer they stayed, the darker the house became. Handprints appeared on mirrors, small and blue-veined. The walls began to weep a thick, sticky fluid that smelled like death mixed with something sweetly familiar. Lights flickered and pulsed in time with the girl’s ragged breathing. One night, the bulb exploded, and in the sudden darkness, her mother swore she saw Josie standing in the doorway, her skin pale and wet, eyes hollow but pleading.\n\nWhen the snow came, the family finally left. But the house stayed, and the neighbors spoke of strange sounds at dusk, soft singing beneath the floorboards, the slow drip of something wet against the windows. Toys arranged themselves in the yard, their seams burst and dripping with dark liquid. And sometimes, if you listen very closely, you’ll hear the faint, bubbling voice of a little girl humming just beneath the walls, waiting for someone to answer.",

    "content": "# Hey folks!\n\nHappy November!\n\nHope you all had an excellent and safe Halloween :)\n\nApologies for the delay on this announcement-- there is no excuse for my tardiness. \n\nI have failed you and I have failed myself.\n\nPerhaps some of you can find it in your heart to forgive me... Please???\n\nIf mercy is too much to ask, I'm going to offer all grudge holders a chance at... revenge! \n\nBut first, this month's announcement:\n\n* Obvious trolls and💩-posters will still be **permabanned**! Read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/17e39nq/please_read_shtposts_permabans_and_literally_1984/). Please report posts that seem like obvious BS, so the mod team is pinged for review!\n* We're also willing to hand out bans as necessary for people who are weirdly hostile in the comments. Be nice to each other please! **And take a moment to review rule 15!**\n* **We're removing most posts that have to do with rape, incest, abuse, and extreme or plotless gore. If your story could read as low-effort shock horror, it probably isn't a good fit for the sub!** Details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/1j1g6hc/march_announcement_and_february_winners/).\n* Remember, this sub is for *fiction*. Posts about current events or politics will be removed, no matter how horrifying they (and the real world) are!\n* Meta posts are not permitted! If you feel the need to talk to the community about the community, take it to the discord! Join the chat [here](https://discord.com/invite/FZ5dVfxsD6)!\n* Be familiar with our Three Strikes and you're out rule-- Read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A).\n* And as always, feel free to reach out in [modmail](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to%3D%252Fr%252FTwoSentenceHorror&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1722380612703530&usg=AOvVaw2giXR5OShF76SQ498PlvRzwith) with feedback or questions!\n\n# November 2025 Contest Prompt: YOU!\n\nTo punish OP for the late announcement, we wanted to give you horror writers a chance at revenge!\n\nFor this month's challenge, you can put each and every one of your readers (and that will include OP) INTO the horror! \n\nUse the word \"you\" in your story. This challenge was initially conceived as a prompt to challenge you to write in the second person! \n\nMost horror stories are written in first or third person-- for example: \"*She is going to stab* ***me***\" or \"*She is going to stab* ***him***\". \n\nIt's pretty rare to see second person stories in any genre (except for the 'choose your own adventure' style of storytelling). A second person story would make deliberate use of language that puts the reader in the story-- for example: \"*She is going to stab* ***you***.\"\n\nBeing that second person story telling is so unconventional, we're opening the scope of this prompt a bit and allowing you to submit any story that makes use of the word \"YOU\". This means that technically you can get away with first person addresses to your reader-- for example: \"*I can't stand people who post late announcements, that's why I am going to stab you.*\" \n\nThis prompt will also technically allow you to use \"you\" in spoken dialogue. For example: \"*She jumped out from behind the bushes and yelled in his face, 'I'm going to stab you!'*\"\n\n  \nSo that's our prompt: **write a two sentence horror story that uses the word \"you\"!** \n\nBonus points if you write a proper second person narrative. If you're hoping to make me suffer for my unforgivable lateness, that's your best bet. I'm gonna read every single entry this month, so you can write with the assurance that you'll be able to temporarily immerse me in whatever hell you craft! \n\nEnjoy your moment of vengeance, fellow horror people!\n\n\n\nHappy writing!\n\n\n\nNovember 2025 Contest Rules\n\n* Prompt: write a two sentence horror story that uses the word \"you\"\n* Tag: \\[nov25\\] or \\[NOV25\\] (Not case sensitive! The order of the characters matters, as we use a search to compile the win-list.)\n* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.\n* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!\n* Contestants can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of your ranked entries will be tallied against other participants to determine our winners.\n* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).\n* Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.\n* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.\n\nHave fun!\n\n\\*\\*Properly formatted November 2025 examples. These meet the prompt. But they might not meet sub rules.\n\n* \\[NOV25\\] You're nervous before your job interview... But the interviewer says \"relax chief, we've already hired someone so this interview is just to bump our metrics for corporate.\"\n* \\[nov25\\] The traffic light turned green, so you pressed the accelerator. In the flash before impact you cursed the other driver for running a red, unaware that a glitch had given him the same signal.\n\nImproperly formatted examples: (The first story gets the tag correct but it fails to follow the prompt since there is no use of the word \"you\". the second story gets the tag wrong by including the space, but follows the prompt)\n\n* \\[nov25\\] I hate writing in second person, so I refuse to do it! \n* \\[nov 25\\] You hated writing in second person but you figured you'd challenge yourself and do it anyway, for the November contest. Unfortunately you fumbled the tag so your submission won't even be included. \n\nWINNERS WILL RECEIVE:\n\n1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places: You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the TSH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.\n\n7 honorable mentions: you'll get visibility and bragging rights!

    "content": "Hi, everyone. Due to the nature of this subreddit and because it's a hot button topic on social media in general, we receive a *lot* of posts and comments about encounters being possible human trafficking.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there is a massive amount of misinformation about what human trafficking is and isn't, and the vast majority of these interactions here in this subreddit and elsewhere on social media are not how trafficking typically occurs.\n\n\n\n# **What is human trafficking, anyway?**\n\n\n\nHuman trafficking is the exploitation ([thanks to u/officialfourloko for pointing this out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16t9o8w/human_trafficking_facts_and_stats/k2ub7cp/)) of people through coercion, deception, force and any combination of those three, for sex, labor, or both. Human trafficking DOES NOT usually occur by spotting some girl alone out and about, following her and kidnapping her or \"tagging\" her to kidnap later. For sex trafficking in particular, the people trafficked almost *always* know and often times love or trust the person that trafficked them. \n\n\n\nHuman trafficking is, disgustingly, a business, and it'd be bad for business to grab some random girl that might have a rich family to look for her, and to do so in front of witnesses. While there have been a few cases of trafficking that have occurred that way (it's sensational and scary, or we wouldn't know about it), it is by far the exception and not the rule. You are more likely to be trafficked by a romantic partner than anyone else.\n\n\n# **How it happens**\n\n\n\"The most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it often involves kidnapping or physically forcing someone into a situation. In reality, most traffickers use psychological means such as, tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims into providing commercial sex or exploitative labor. Another myth is that traffickers target victims they don't know. Many survivors have been trafficked by romantic partners, including spouses, and by family members, including parents.\" - Polaris Project\n\n\n\n\"Perpetrators of human trafficking span all racial, ethnic, and gender demographics and are as diverse as survivors. Some use their privilege, wealth, and power as a means of control while others experience the same socio-economic oppression as their victims. They include individuals, business owners, members of a gang or network, parents or family members of victims, intimate partners, owners of farms or restaurants, and powerful corporate executives and government representatives.\" - Polaris Project\n\n\n# **Recent Statistics**\n\n\nBased on data* from the [2021 National Report](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/en/resources/2021-national-report) by The Human Trafficking Hotline:\n\n\n\n* **72% of trafficking is for sex**, 10% is for forced labor, 4% is for both sex and labor, with the remaining 14% being for unspecified purposes.\n\n\n\n* 62% of sex trafficking victims are adults, **28% are minors**. In some cases, demographic information is not provided to the hotline, which is why the percentage here doesn't add up to 100%.\n\n\n\n* 84% of sex trafficking victims are female, 8% are male, with the remaining 8% having another gender identity, defined as someone who identifies as any identity other than cisgender male or female.\n\n\n\nIn the vast majority of cases (88%), the country of origin of victims was unknown. When the country of origin *was* known, the majority of victims were US citizens. \n\n\n\n*note: this data is all from substantiated tips received by the hotline from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, most of which came from victims themselves. \n\n\n#  **Additional Info & Sources**\n\n\nFor more information, please visit [Polaris Project](https://polarisproject.org/victims-traffickers), a wonderful resource for information about human trafficking and ways to help if you are interested, or [The Human Trafficking Hotline](http://humantraffickinghotline.org/), which keeps one of the most extensive data sets on human trafficking in the United States.\n\n\n\nIf you believe you or someone you know is a victim of human trafficking, you can also call +18883737888 (open 24/7) to make a report (this is a United States number, if you suspect human trafficking in another country, please refer to your country’s national human trafficking hotline).\n\n\n\nYou can also text 233733 with HELP or INFO to get more information or to report suspected human trafficking in the United States.\n\n\n\n[Here is a story](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/p1bmel/i_was_a_victim_of_sex_trafficking) from this exact subreddit that we approved with verification that describes OP's experience.\n\n\n\nAny misinformation about trafficking in this thread will result in it being locked.  Any off topic comments will be removed.",

    "content": "I'm getting real sick of people getting shitty over their stories being removed, so here's a list of stories that inarguably belong here. If you read this thread and you have a story, compare it to any of these. If it wouldn't fit in with this list of stories, *it does not belong on this subreddit.* Usually if you're not sure if a story belongs here, it doesn't. \n\n\n1. [They stalked all the stay at home moms](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7bhjfl/they_stalked_all_the_stay_at_home_moms) - I don't think I need to explain why this fits. I know there is some skepticism in the comments, but as OP was interactive with them prior to deleting her account (typically creative writing pieces OP doesn't respond to many, if any, comments), I think it's okay to leave up. \n\n2. [This happened quite a long time ago yet it is never too far from my mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/gi7emq/this_happened_quite_a_long_time_ago_yet_it_is) - this fits because although OP made it out unharmed and nothing really happened, the insistence of \"coming up here\" and the fact the creeper left *surgical shears* where they are not needed pushes this story into \"out of the ordinary\" \n\n3. [No good deed goes unpunished](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1g3x4f/no_good_deed_goes_unpunished) - Here is an example of a car story that would actually remain up. It takes place almost entirely in the car, but it is not someone just following her, or road raging and she goes home physically unharmed. This would be terrifying to go through. (Side note: this is also one of my favorite stories of all time as I love it when assholes like this get their due comeuppance) \n\n4. [I was a victim of sex trafficking](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/p1bmel/i_was_a_victim_of_sex_trafficking) - this is a real story about actual human trafficking. If you \"think\" you escaped human trafficking, most likely you didn't. Human trafficking overwhelmingly does not happen the way most people think it does, the reality is truly insidious and horrifying. \n\n5. [The office in the middle of nowhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1t2uwq/the_office_in_the_middle_of_nowhere) - I don't think I really need to explain this one either, I just wanted an example for the \"found something creepy/bizarre\" category. \n\n\nAs a reminder, stories posted in this subreddit should have been life threatening (stories 1 and 3), extremely unusual/uncommon (stories 2 and 4) or about a time when you stumbled upon something excessively creepy (story 5). \n\n\n# What does not belong here? \n\n* You *think* you were followed because somebody was acting weird but you didn't interact much, if at all and eventually they either gave up or you lost them with minimal effort on your part (so didn't have to hide/confront them) \n\n* You can't say for certain what someone's intentions were, you can only guess at what they were doing or planning. \n\n* Being harassed/stared at/catcalled. I understand how frightening and enraging this is, but if you're a woman and you live in any moderately sized city or larger, you will have experienced this. It's entirely too common to be worthy of a story here. That doesn't change the fact it's threatening, disgusting, disrespectful behavior, but this subreddit is meant to focus on, again, life-threatening encounters.\n * an additional note here: stories containing excessive detail about your personal appearance will be removed, even if they fit the standards for this sub. It's a harmful belief to perpetuate in multiple directions that only conventionally attractive people get creeped on - anyone can be harassed on the street. Oftentimes what you look like has little, if anything to do with it, it's the loser's complete lack of regard and view of you as a person and (and for women, lack of respect for us) that causes them to harass you. If our appearance mattered that much for it, 11/12 year olds that look very much like children to anyone with an ounce of brain matter would not get catcalled. \n\n* The encounter didn't happen to you, but happened to your mother, sister, father, friend, aunt, etc. \n\nI reserve the right to edit this post to add/remove stories as I see fit, as well as adjust formatting. I suppose we could use this post as well for any comments/suggestions for the sub, cuz why not.\n\nEdit: if you're just gonna bitch that this sub is tOo StRiCt you're wasting your time. Nothing in that regard will be changing.",

    "content": "English is not my first language, I’m sorry if there’s any mistakes! \n\nThis happened to me when I was about 14. It was in 2020, in the cold winter of Canada. At that time the confinement was obliged. Every 2 day we would have class at school, else it was online. So after my online class i had to practice my acting part for my theatre class. Since everyone was home, i didn’t want to bother anyone with my loud voice and cries. So i decided to go in the woods. So you all gotta know that i live in the woods, i dont really have any neighbours and no one walks in the woods behind my house since it’s a private property. \n\nAnyway, i had asked my sister if she wanted to accompany me but when we got out she said she had a weird feeling and she didn’t wanna come along anymore and ran back to the house. So instead a grabbed my dog which is a pug and at that time he was 3 years old. Important thing to know my dog can’t bark at all and he still can’t to this day. He is very social and cuddly he would even run away with a kidnapper. So I get down my property to enter the woods behind the trees there are and i get on the wood path. I know that wood like i know my back pocket i never got lost. So as i was walking forward with my dog, i record a video of myself to see what i need to improve on my acting, that’s when I see someone behind me. Of course i turn back and look at the person. To this day I don’t know if it was a man or a woman, but that person was clothed head to toe with dirty blankets and dirty coats. Yes, coatS. They had a plastic bag, a black one that we use in restaurants for the trash, ut was huge. I still remember to this day that vision of the person. I could only see their eyes. In the other hand they had a sharp looking object that I couldn’t identify. So out of instinct i started walking faster, because no one ever comes to these woods especially on a -34°C winter. But my dog was not going forward. He was still and was not moving an inch fixing with fear that person and he starts barking. That’s when I knew something was off, because my dog doesn’t bark and likes everyone but at that moment i could see the situation wasn’t safe. So i whistle to him and he walks but head facing back and the person starts laughing. As they were laughing they said:\nI’m not scared of dogs. \nIn my head i was asking myself, why would someone tell me this? \nSo i walk faster telling my dog to follow me and i hear the snow crack, the person is walking faster and starts following me. \nThat was it for me, i picked up my dog and started running, i could hear the stranger running after me. \nThen i get to a dead end. There’s 3 thoughts going through my mind. \n1-going straight forward between the trees until i find a path.\n2-jumping off the snow cliff that is at least 10 feet high.\n3-go back on my feet and run for my life.\nAll these knowing i had to have my dog in my arms.\nI can’t think long enough, that i hear the stranger’s footsteps on the snow and i decided to jump off the cliff with my dog in my arms. I was being swallowed by the soft snow, because here in Canada there can be up to 3 feet tall snow on the floor. I didn’t have my snow suit i was freezing and ice was forming on my legs and hands. I thought i was going to die, but my dog is digging me out. I pick him up again and run towards the second cliff in front of me. I look back and there i see that stranger for the last time. They had their left hand on their forehead looking left and right at the horizon looking for me. They spot me and starts walking towards me. I ran as fast as i could following the path that i knew would lend me to the street in front of my house. I ran for minutes with my dog in my arms and the ice on my legs in the freezing cold. I get back to my house and i decided to act like nothing happened, went back to my room, and i just stared at the void. \n\nI hope i never meet that person ever again.",

    "content": "for a little bit of context, i (17f) live in a fairly small town with not a lot of people. at the time this story took place, i had been working at a local burger king for about 2 months. i didn't have a car, or any way to get a ride, but it's about a 10 minute walk which worked for me and due to the tight knit community my dad didnt think it was dangerous. (due to the fact that i was still in school at the time i was only allowed to work until 11pm, and my typical schedule was usually 3-11) \n\none night im scheduled a 3-11; sucky shift, asshole customers, all the usual. the day ends i start walking home on the same route i always walk. as im about half way through my walk i notice a guy walking down the street the opposite direction. it was dark, and the only thing i could really see was that he was *actually* there. he apparently didnt know that i saw him, because the moment he saw me he stopped walking and crouched into a bush (the bush was basically right in front of the route i usually take home, but im not that stupid.) \n\nat this point im like fuck no, dont care what this guy is doing but i want no part of it. i start walking the other direction to take a different route, and all of the sudden this guy starts calling out to me asking for help. when i turned around, he was starting to run my direction. my heart was in my stomach- im certain that ive never run that fast in my life. i run as fast as i can and eventually get pretty close to my house. i get the door unlocked and slam it shut as fast as i can. \n\ni was pretty shaken by the scenario but really had no clue *what* he was actually trying to do, so i brushed it off and just decided that id carry pepper spray in the future. a few days later, it turns out that a girl from my highschool was almost kidnapped by a man who also tried to follow her home. \n\nfrom that day on, i never walked home again. for anyone out there who thinks it \"wouldnt happen to you,\" you're wrong. always be safe, cause it really could be you.",

So it reminded me of this situation.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, we were mushroom picking with a friend in the woods. I thought saw some mushrooms, I was walking towards them, looking attentively and trying to understand if there's mushrooms there or not.\n\nAnd suddenly my eyes shift and I realise this whole time, I was walking towards A MAN, who was just standing there, looking at me. He was staring and smiling and doing the \"come closer\" gesture. I have no idea how long this has been going on, and this whole time I was coming right towards him, but somehow I didn't notice him until the last moment. \n\nI got scared and ran to my friend, we laughed about it and continued the mushroom picking, lol. We didn't even go away too far from there. At the time it just seemed like a funny story.\n\nBut the more I think about it, the more it creeps me out. WHAT???? What was he going to do? Did he see me walking there and instantly decided to do the \"come closer\" thing?? Was it supposed to be a prank? I'm so confused.\n\nAnyone got theories on what was his motivation? I still have no idea.",

So my son and I make the best of it and start to play. We live at the end of a street, not a dead-end but right near a stop sign. A man with a backpack started to walk down the road, nothing new. We live in a rundown part of town. He walks up the road and then a little while later he comes back. He makes an L, walking the street I live on and then a little ways past the stop sign and turns around to do it again.The 3rd time he is just eyeballing me with a slight smirk, yet he does is again making an L. Up and down. up and down. That gut feeling started to sink. I was boxed in, i was prepared to toss my kid over the backyard fence. I called my neighbor to have her husband come outside because I was getting nervous. The man was at the stop sign and was turning right to do his L. At this time the man stopped behind a tree, directly blocking him from my line of sight. I walk to where I can see him and he is pulling something out of his backpack. My neighbor steps outside at this time also. We make eye contact and the man steps back out from the tree with a hatchet in hand. He locks eyes with my neighbor, looks back at my son and i, and then the man and I both start to run. I run straight across the road to my neighbor, pretty much threw my son to my neighbor. The man didnt chase me up the stair or anything but he was about 4 feet away when I crossed the street, hatchet raised in the air. He was pacing working up the nerve. I could feeling the energy from him just growing darker. Scariest shit in my life. So yeah Mr. Hatchetman, let's not meet again.",

    "content": "Something happened to me years ago, and I think about it quite often, and I admit that it still makes my blood run cold.\n\nWhen I was younger (around 10 years old) I was walking with my best friend, the same age as me, but we didn't have any adults with us.\n\nIt was a small, not too busy road, in a sort of subdivision that formed a loop, with a few houses, but mainly forest around.\nImportant note: we had already taken a tour of the neighborhood, this was perhaps the second or third we had done.\n\nWe were walking quietly, and I hear the sound of an engine, and when I turn I see a white van behind us, driving slowly. We tell ourselves that she wants to pass us, as the road is not very wide, so we move aside to let her pass next to us. She advances a few meters, and stops. \n\nAt the moment, my best friend and I don't notice each other too much and continue to move forward, knowing that the van is just ahead, stopped. And I don't know, at the time I have a weird feeling that comes over me, and I grab my best friend's arm to make us stop. \n\nI don't know how long we stared at the van, it feels like it lasted a while but it was a long time ago so maybe it was only a few seconds. \n\nSuddenly, we saw the passenger side door open, towards the forest. I pulled my best friend's arm so we could go in the other direction, and I don't really know why, we started running.\nWe ran for a while, and when we stopped we started talking about what had just happened, and she was scared too. We sat in a park, and started to relax a little, then laughed and told ourselves that we had panicked for nothing. \n\nAfter a while, maybe half an hour, we said to ourselves that we were going to go back, but we had to go back along the road where the van had stopped to go back. We weren't really reassured but we told ourselves that everything was fine, so we turned back.\n\nWhen we arrived on the road, to our great relief the van was no longer there. So we move forward quietly, to where she was, and that's where we notice something, and my god just writing it today still gives me chills. \nSo, on the forest edge side, we see something red. Really, maybe a meter from the road, at most.\n\nWe approach, and we discover a little red sweater. It was a knitted wool sweater, very bright red. I already found it small for the time so I'm sure it was a child's size.\nIt looked like someone had tried to burn it, because it was blackened in places, and there was like a small empty plastic container next to it - I imagine maybe gasoline or something flammable.\n\nWhat is very strange is that I am sure that this sweater was not there during our first tour, because it was red like that I think we would have seen it, and there were no dead leaves on it, although the ground was littered with them.\n\nWe never told our parents about this, but even today, I can't help but think that the people in that van didn't mean well to us. And I also can't help but think that it was them who dropped off that red sweater, and tried to burn it.\n\nWhat do you think? Was my childhood eye biased and made me paranoid or did I unknowingly escape something very serious? \n\nAnd that red sweater? What was it, who was it, why? Every time I think about it, it terrifies me.",

    "content": "I moved to East Los Angeles the summer after high school. My parents bought the house from my aunt and uncle who had just moved out. We already had family in that area so it felt familiar. The neighborhood was nice and quiet.\n\nThe plan for me was to live with my parents and save money while I figured out what I wanted next. I was getting ready to start community college and apply to a medical assistant program.\n\nBack then, everyone had an opinion about East LA. People loved to describe it as dangerous, even though most of them had never been there. I grew up visiting my cousins in that same area, and it was never as dramatic as people made it sound. These places are not scary to me. They are just neighborhoods where people live.\n\nI met Michael at my cousin’s house party that summer. He had tattoos and looked edgy. When he asked me out, I said yes. I was flattered and curious what he would be like.\n\nHe told me he knew a place with the best guava nectar in town and that we could go to a drive-in movie afterward. I actually laughed. I like guava nectar but I had never heard anyone hype it up like that. But like I said, I was curious and I agreed.\n\nHe parked at the drive-in first. He said we could leave the car there, walk to the restaurant, and come back for the movie. We even asked the employees if that was okay. They said yes, as long as we paid a small fee, which he did.\n\nSomething about the plan felt strange. The restaurant was about a 20 minute walk away, and the movie started at 9pm. It was close to 8. I asked him if it was smart to walk by ourselves so late. He smiled and said he thought I was not afraid of neighborhoods like this since I had spent so much time in East LA. He said it like a challenge. I remembered mentioning that earlier, and he used my own words to keep me from saying no. So I went along with it. Very few people were on the street and it was dark.\n\nAs we got closer to the restaurant, he stopped a few times to show me videos on his phone. They were silly clips that he thought were funny. I was uneasy about the walk. It felt like Michael wanted it to last longer than it should have. Something was off. Looking back, I think Michael was stalling.\n\nThen a car pulled up beside us. A masked man got out and walked toward us. For a second, I thought it might be a prank, like for a YouTube video.\n\nThen I heard his voice and he said \"I need your phone and wallet.\"\n\nI remember thinking he sounded young, maybe high school age. He also sounded nervous and out of breath. I can’t prove this but I could tell this was not something he had done before.\n\nThat was the only time I'd ever been mugged and I don't know what other muggers sound like, but I just know that guy had never done it before.\n\nI think he was hesitating. At one point, I even remember the driver yelled \"hurry up man.\"\n\nHe yelled back \"I am hurrying bro. She is right here.\"\n\nHe kept looking at Michael. Michael looked back. I could not see their faces, but something in that moment told me they knew each other. He took my wallet and phone, then ran back to the car, and they drove away.\n\nMichael stood still. He did not help, but to be fair, I don't know what he could have done. You never know what someone with a gun might do if you make the wrong move. I was in shock, trying to make sense of what had just happened.\n\nI told Michael we should go to the police. He kept insisting we should still get guava nectar so I could calm down. I had just been robbed, and he was offering me juice.\n\nI had no phone and no way to call anyone, and somehow we were still walking to get guava nectar. We got guava nectar and then walked back.\n\nWhen we finally got to the car, I told him again that I wanted to go to the police. This time, I said that if he refused, I would ask someone else in the parking lot to call. He finally said okay.\n\nAt the station, we gave our statements and it got even stranger. I said the car was gray because I knew what I saw. Michael said it was white. I said there had been a driver who yelled “hurry up, man.” Michael said there was no driver, that it was the same person who got back into the drivers seat of the car and drove himself off. He kept adding little changes.\n\nThe officers were polite, but I could feel their patience thinning. When they realized we were giving them two different stories, one of them sighed. She said she could not really investigate if two people who were both there could not agree on what happened. I knew right then they were not going to investigate this any further.\n\nMichael drove me home. When my parents found out what had happened, they were furious. My mom told me never to talk to Michael again. She did not need to repeat herself. Thankfully, I did not lose much. My wallet was easy to replace, and I needed a new phone anyway.\n\nI have lived in East LA ever since that summer. Eight years later, I have never had another bad experience here. The more I think about that night, the more I am convinced that Michael planned it. I can still remember how he stalled to give them more time to come and mug me. I can still remember how calm he stayed through all of it. I can still remember how he tried to give the police completely different information from what had really happened. No way that was all an accident.\n\nSince then, I've seen Michael a few times at different things. He always wants to make small talk and invite me to things. I keep my guard up and don't agree to anything.",

    "content": "I worked briefly as a psych tech a few years ago.\n\nThat clinic was a nice place to work. Most of the staff were the same age, early in their careers, and friends with each other. I don’t think any of us planned to stay there super long. I think we were really just there because we wanted to put it on our resumes.\n\nTo be honest, I never loved the business model. The best way I can describe it is that it felt like a subscription service. The place wasn’t really helping people create individualized plans for how to treat their issues. It just wanted to sign them up for continued care forever, two appointments per month, bundle packages. Everyone pretended that was fine.\n\nJenny was one of the nurses there. She was nice and we got along.\n\nOne day, Jenny and I left work a little early so we could go to Marshalls and buy holiday decorations. I still had a work call to make but my manager said I could do that later from home. We could make work calls through an app. I didn’t have a car back then. Jenny drove us and she was going to take me home afterward.\n\nWe got to the store and picked out little decorations. The checkout line was long and was going to take at least half an hour. I figured that was a good time to make the call I still had to do. I asked Jenny if I could take care of that in her car while she waited in line. She said ok and gave me her keys.\n\nI had never made work calls outside of work before, and I completely forgot that I’d need to write notes. I realized that while I was already on the phone. So that put me in an awkward situation. I said something like \"hold on, just give me a minute, I need to find a pen.\"\n\nI probably shouldn’t have done this. I opened the box between the driver and passenger seat to see if there was anything I could use to write my notes.\n\nJenny had some things I could use in there. She had a little notebook and some pens. I was going to rudely use her notebook without permission and then explain it to her when she’d get back to the car. I thought we’d laugh it off together.\n\nThinking back on this, I would not even think about doing that today. I overstepped my boundaries by opening the box and opening a private notebook.\n\nI opened it and started flipping to find the first blank page. As I flipped, I saw that each page had a name, an address, and some notes next to it. The names looked familiar at first, but I didn’t think they were patients. That wouldn’t have made any sense, since Jenny had no reason to keep a notebook like that.\n\nBut the more I flipped through, the clearer it became. Yes, they were all patients from our clinic. Every single one. It had their addresses. Also, a description of the house. It said things like “blue house” or “house with the basketball hoop.”\n\nMy jaw must have dropped. I still can’t think of any reason why someone would have those notes.\n\nI put the notebook back, closed the box, put my phone on speaker, and finished my call using the notes app on my phone. I waited quietly until Jenny came back.\n\nI never told anyone about this. I really can’t think of any reason for a nurse to keep that kind of notebook with her.",

    "content": "So I recently touched on this via a comment in a r/AskReddit thread but - as I’d basically buried this memory for a close to a decade - simply just re-remembering this experience was all it took for the floodgates to open and for it allllll to come back, including details I’d failed to include in my r/AskReddit comment. That said, I felt compelled to share here, especially bc it felt cathartic to type it all out for the very first time (on that note, apologies for the novel)! This may be a milder LNM post/experience, but I can assure that it absolutely was an insanely terrifying experience for me at the time, and - even to this day - I am 100% convinced that the man in this story is a potential predator/stalker (or, at the very least, possesses similar qualities/characteristics).\n\nSo back in 2014, I’d gone on a first date with a guy I’d matched with on Tinder. I lived in DC at the time and worked on Capitol Hill for a U.S. Congressman (I was 28-29 at the time). While nice, handsome, and a self-declared ‘Southern Gentleman’, Tinder Guy was extremely…pushy leading up to our first date. My job was even *more* insanely busy than normal during that time, often requiring frequent all-nighters and entailing exactly zero social life to speak of. \n\nLooking back now, it’s painfully obvious that I absolutely did not have the time/space in my life for dating back then, but, after months of my bestie begging me to let her create a Tinder profile, I basically acquiesced / surrendered). For weeks, I’d tried to reschedule said first date due to work being crazy, but Tinder Guy **literally** would not take no for answer. He also was extremely manipulative (and clearly gifted at it), as he basically guilt tripped me / broke me down to finally agree to a first date with him (only dinner was mentioned for the date). So, I go on the date.\n\nWhile the date went fine ‘on paper’ and probably looked as such to any fellow patrons/bystanders, Tinder Guy nonetheless kinda gave me the ick for some reason. At the time, I couldn’t lock down why; he was nice/polite, had a great job, was attractive…but, still, something about the way he would continue to gaze/stare at me *so* intently, without blinking, was so unsettling. It was like he was playing some intense, weird-ass staring contest where he was the only contestant. \n\nThere were a lot of other ‘icks’ and red flags during our date, but the first major one was the fact that I was casually held hostage (or at least, it felt that way). At the conclusion of our dinner, and after politely thanking him for the meal (and knowing 100% that there will be no second/future dates with this guy), I try to make my exit home, telling him that I had a busy/early work day ahead of me (not a lie). Instead, Tinder Guy - of course - pressures me into going to a bar next door with him for a ‘night cap.’ Looking back now, (and thanks to therapy), I’ve learned a lot about manipulation and how it can be weaponized. Tinder Guy was a master at this, and I had no chance.\n\nAfter 2 drinks (that I didn’t want), I again mention that I need to get home, with a little more force this time. Tinder Guy acts like he doesn’t hear me, gets up, and heads to the bar before returning with beers for both us. I’m beginning to get annoyed and super pissed so, after a few minutes, I fake an incoming phone call from my boss, essentially channeling my inner Meryl Streep, and proceed to (attempt to) give the best acting performance of my life. …Andddd, not to pat myself in on the back or anything, but I should obviously get alllll the Oscars because, holy shit, it worked! \n\nThe good news: Tinder Guy totally buys my Oscar-worthy acting, finally stops ignoring my polite pleas to go home, and he agrees to let me/his hostage go. However, he insists on **SHARING AN UBER** ‘home’, even though we live in completely separate neighborhoods nowhere near each other - Not to mention, the very obvious fact that I ABSOLUTELY did not want this creeper to potentially gain any sort of idea where I lived or come *anywhere* near I lived. \n\nQuite frankly, I knew at that point that I did NOT want to spend one more minute nor have *anything* more to do with this creepy stranger (including being trapped in a confined space like a car with this person). So I tried to refuse - **repeatedly** - as I was feeling extremely/increasingly more uncomfortable and, again, obviously not wanting him to see where I live. ….But he literally wouldn’t take no for an answer.\n\nSo, in a major ‘What tf are you doing?!’ moment, especially looking back now 10* years later, I silently stomached my anxiety/concerns/protests, and we proceed to Uber to my neighborhood (though I did get out at a different house/address a few blocks from my place, so he wouldn’t have my exact address). As I attempt to disembark from the car as quick as The Flash, Tinder Guy follows behind me, grabs my shoulder and spins me around, before then *aggressively* kissing me - like I’m talking, straight up manhandling my face with his tongue (apologies for the NSFW description, especially if it results in bringing you any sort of trauma….but if I had to experience it, you do too, lol). \n\nAs Tinder Guy finally lets go of my head/face, I’m trying my best to swallow back vomit and, after 10 minutes of placating him, I *finally* get him to accept that this [nightmare] first date is finally over, that I’m going to sleep (seemingly in the complete random stranger’s house, whom we’re currently standing in front of), and he reluctantly agrees to leave.\n\nAs soon as ‘our’ Uber leaves with Tinder Guy and is out of sight, I run to my actual home, lock and deadbolt the door as I soon as I get inside, and literally sink there to the floor in disbelief. In the end, once I’d calmed down and felt secure again, I was mostly just relieved to be home safe & sound and that I’d survived a date with a deeply unsettling, creepy, and disconcerting man. I had even joked to my roommates at the time: “WELP, can’t wait to never talk to that dude again!!!” \n\n….But, alas, 10 years ago me was a naive fool. Instead, immediately following our date, Tinder Guy proceeded to send me a barrage of texts that entire rest of the night, fawning all over me, and mostly asking, over….and over….again: “Can we FaceTime/video chat?” (Keep in mind, this was literally **one*** hour after I’d gotten home from our date). I lied (this whole experience has taught me that I’m actually not a terrible liar? At least under duress, lol) and said I was already in bed/basically asleep and - since I had absolutely zero intention to ever speak to this person again - I naively thought that was the end of it.\n\nTinder Guy continued to text me *non-stop* over the next few days, and I’d either ignore him or send him short/curt responses. While it was a cop-out, I’d planned on messaging him the truth/letting him down gently at the end of the week aka when I wasn’t swimming in work craziness. As I mentioned earlier (and for context/background for what I describe next), I worked on Capitol Hill for a U.S. Congressman at the time and, as such, my office was subject to strict security screenings (metal detectors and security/X-ray scanner at the building entrance), which also extended to incoming mail, packages, and deliveries.\n\nSo the day after this first date debacle, I get a call on my office line from the off-site Capitol Hill package center, stating that they’re currently processing/screening a package for me, and that it should be delivered to my office in 2 days. I think, ‘Hmm, that’s odd- I’m not expecting anything, so who would mail me something?’ But I shrug it off as it’s not the first time I’ve received unsolicited packages due to the nature of my job, and I basically forget all about it. …..Until that Friday. Our office receptionist comes to my cubicle with….an (obnoxiously gaudy/over the top) bouquet of roses. And an accompanying card. Right away, I **immediately** know who’s responsible. \n\nHowever, the real reason I felt so deeply unsettled was the sheer fact that I’d **never** told Tinder Guy who I worked for or, hell, even which state/delegation my boss belonged to. I’d given him literally zero clues as to whom the Member I worked for (purposefully, I might add), and, while my social media settings were pretty tight/private anyway, I didn’t include the name of the Member office in which I worked in any of my online profiles (including LinkedIn). \n\nI also didn’t give Tinder Guy my last name, so I have no idea how he would’ve found it to begin with; there were/are 535 total Congressional offices on Capitol Hill (435 House offices and 100 Senate). That said, there’s approx 15K+ Congressional staffers who work on the Hill, and there’s no telling how many staffers (who share my first name) you’d have to go through in searching for my last name and office address. **I shared exactly zero identifying details about the Member Office in which I worked and, to this day, I have no idea how Tinder Guy found out this identifying info when I’d only provided him with just my first name and general employer info.**\n\nNeedless to say, if I wasn’t creeped out **enough** by this guy before or at that point, now I was 1000%, full-fledged freaked out, especially reading the note that accompanied the flowers (lowlights: he talked about how great of a kisser I was…*vomit*…what he wanted to do to me…*bile is rising*…how he hoped I could meet his family…*add ‘delusional’ to the list of descriptors for this guy*…and how he ‘couldn’t wait to see me again’…*lol in your dreams, bud/I look forward to seeing you never*)\n\nOne good thing that came out of this experience is that it finally (and obviously) gave me the balls to end things with Tinder Guy via text. Dating is the fucking worst and, until this experience, if I was talking to someone but also knew at the same time that I wasn’t interested, I would still engage/respond to messages and basically lead them on - all bc I didn’t want to hurt their feelings and felt guilty. I now realize how unfair that is/was to the other person and have since vowed I’ll never cop out when it comes to uncomfortable issues/topics/messages that the recipient needs and deserves to hear. It’s also helped instill in me that whole “Fuck politeness” mantra; I’m fortunately in a serious, longterm relationship now but, while dating or even in my regular life, if I ever feel uncomfortable and uneasy like Tinder Guy made me feel, I now fight the urge to be agreeable and polite and either directly block/cut ties, or at least explain why I’m blocking before cutting off communication.\n\nAnyway, apologies for the length; I’ve never shared this with anyone outside of my roommates at the time, so it was cathartic to type it out. Stay safe out there!",

    "content": "Early Sunday morning at around 5am I woke up to this violent banging and shaking on my door. I live alone on the second floor of an old apartment building downtown in a very small town. I’ve been taking benadryl to sleep for a few months and sometimes I sleep weird, so for a moment I thought “Did that really just happen?” and then I heard who ever it was start doing it again. This time these super loud bangs like they’re charging the door. That’s when I realized both my fan and AC unit were off. The power was off. \n\nIt stopped after the second time and I heard someone stomp down the stairs and I laid here processing what just happened. It’s dead quiet without the fan, and I heard a guys voice outside saying “no, we were just walking.” I’m still lying here motionless in fear, and try to think of someone to call. A few months ago my downstairs neighbor got my package by mistake and messaged me on facebook about it after seeing my name. I’ve seen her a few times and I know she has these two absolutely RIPPED pit-bulls. So I message her thinking she won’t even see it till she wakes up. Nope. She immediately starts calling me. She says she saw the two guys come out of the building after trying her door, mine, and the person across the hall from me - and then tried to lie and say it wasn’t them. \n\nShe’s already called the police at this point and the intruders are gone, so I go downstairs to meet her and we find the breaker box door ripped off, and all the switches off (which sucks because there’s a camera outside, but our landlord said he’s trying to backup the footage to see if it caught them). Our other neighbor wakes up, she had no idea it was happening. Finally the downstairs neighbor got the power turned back on, and the cops showed up within like 20 minutes to get statements. Apparently the downstairs girl was awake the whole time and heard them trying her door, and her dogs were doing a low growl thing instead of barking. She gave them their descriptions. Cops haven’t updated any of us yet. \n\nSome of my coworkers said maybe it was the TikTok trend where they kick the door in? Thankfully my door opens outwards not inward if that’s the case. But I feel like cutting the power and trying to open all 3 units seems more like an actual break in.  I’ve barely slept since it happened and I’m about to try now. \n\nTo the two guys who tried to break in at 5am, consider yourselves lucky you aren’t being crapped out by a pit-bull right now - and let’s not ever meet again.",

    "content": "After I attended a work-related conference, I received a creepy LinkedIn connection request from \"Tom\" with a note saying, \"We attended the same talk together. I liked how you laughed, but we never got a chance to say hello.\" (I don't recall the exact wording but hope you get an idea.) I found the message extremely odd because several folks saw my company t-shirt at the conference between the talks or during the meals and spoke enthusiastically about my company's work. I deleted the LinkedIn invite without further thoughts.\n\nAbout two days later, a long-lost high school friend, \"Julia\", emailed me saying \"Tom\" attended the conference, saw me but never got a chance to connect. Julia explained Tom was her former client, may be anxious about reaching out to people and really, really wanted to meet me. She also cc this guy in the email. Then Tom replied on the thread starting a chat. I was pissed how she gave away my email address without my permission. I explained that (without Tom in cc)  I indeed attended the conference, but I   no longer add people I do not know to my social network due to the number of online frauds. She apologized.\n\nThen Tom sent connection requests to my other social networks for friends and family. (My other accounts are private.) I deleted the invites. \n\nTom followed my public, work-related social account, copied the format of my account to his own and reposted the content. I removed him from the followers but the behaviour didn't stop. I blocked him, but this in theory doesn't prevent him from seeing the content on a private window.\n\nThe notion that Tom constantly rejected being rejected scared me. Not my first time encountering such kind of people. You may say that I should give him a chance, but I really do not owe him an explanation. I told my siblings so that they're no high alert on any suspicious messages.",

I was always curious about what was inside, but I never had the guts to even ask my cousins to go in there. Even during the day, the club felt so off. I don’t even know why, maybe because it was surrounded by trees it just had this weird vibe.\n\nWhen I was around 13 or 14 (I don’t remember exactly), I had a friend who was in the same grade as me, but he moved to another country. He would visit every summer, and every time he came back, he’d call me up. One summer, we were really bored, and the idea came up that we should finally go to that abandoned club. He was braver than me, so he said he’d go in first because there’s no way I’d have the balls to go first.\n\nAround 10 PM, we arrived there with our bikes. It was pitch dark, with maybe two or three lampposts spaced far apart, so the lighting was really dim. When we stood in front of the club, it felt eerie. We spent like twenty minutes just trying to gather the courage to go in.\n\nFinally, we did. We climbed over the broken glass at the door and squeezed through. Once we were inside, we turned on our phone flashlights. The place was a complete mess garbage bags all over the walls, some needles on the ground (which was honestly really scary to see), and the whole interior was just weird. It was a pretty big space, with this odd architecture paths that led around in circles for no reason.\n\nMe and my friend were scared shitless. We tried to stay as quiet as possible so we wouldn’t wake up some junkie or whatever else might’ve been living there. Then, while I was staring at the bar counter for like five seconds, my friend disappeared.\n\nOh my god, my heart dropped. I did a full 360 with the flashlight, and he was *gone*. I yelled his name and then something jumped on me from behind. It was him, laughing so hard while I was having a heart attack. I was so mad but also super relieved.\n\nBut while he was laughing, I suddenly heard another laugh one that wasn’t his. I’d actually heard it at first but didn’t fully register it until it clicked, that laugh wasn’t supposed to be there. I turned my flashlight toward the sound, and there was this guy a hobo, I think ,tall, skinny, with long, messy hair. I couldn’t even see his face properly.\n\nI screamed and bolted out of there with my friend. We jumped on our bikes and pedaled so hard back to my grandma’s house. That was seriously one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced. Later that night, when we finally talked about it,\n\nHow did we not hear him?, we were dead silent. Every step we made was so loud. So how the hell did he get that close without a sound?, and the fact that he was laughing with us made it so scarier, he was probably insane or something",

    "content": "This happened back in 2015 or 2016 when my ex- boyfriend and I went camping in Mendocino, California.\n\nA few sites over was this tiny green one-person tent. The kind that barely fits a body. What struck me right away was how empty the site looked - no cooler, no chair, no lantern, no shoes outside. Just the little tent, zipped up tight.\n\nWe went to bed, and sometime after 10pm it started.\n\nLaughter.\n\nNot a group around a fire. Not drunk campers. And definitely not an animal - I know what barred owls and coyotes sound like. This was human laughter.\n\nAt first I thought it was maybe a radio or a Bluetooth speaker. But it never stopped. Not once.\n\nAll night long, until sunrise. Same tone, same rhythm, no pauses for breath. Too steady, too repetitive to be a person in psychosis or on drugs. It sounded mechanical, like a loop.\n\nThat’s what makes it worse. Because if it wasn’t someone actually laughing, then it was someone who had recorded laughter beforehand and brought it out into the woods… to sit in that tiny tent, in the dark, and listen to it for hours.\n\nWhen we woke up around 6:30-7 AM, the laughter was still going. We packed up fast and left without ever seeing who - or what - was inside.\n\nAnd even now, years later, I can’t shake the thought that someone actually decided that was how they wanted to spend the night. A tent, a recording of endless laughter, and the silence of the woods around them.\n\n\nLet’s not meet.",

    "content": "My friend (16) and I (17F) had been drinking at our friend's place and were pretty drunk. At like 5 am we finally decided to head home and took the first bus. However, when we climbed to the back of the bus, a guy (~60M) with a goofy hat immediately complimented my friend, saying they were good looking. Without thinking too much my friend thanked him.\n\nAs we sat down, the man joined us, sitting right next to me. He went on about how he was so drunk and proceeded to ask my friend for a drink. My friend accepted the offer for 5€. However, the man continued the questions as he was looking for the bill in his pockets. He asked for my friend's name and at which stop we would get off. He would repeat the question over and over again even though my friend told him that they were not comfortable with answering. That's when we actually started to realize the true nature of the situation...\n\nFortunately that's also when some younger guys decided to step in. They told him to move and to stop bothering us. He was very resistant even though he eventually obeyed. He gave the drink back to my friend and went to sit elsewhere. This interaction caused a verbal fight between the man and the younger men. The younger men were also drunk and provoked the older man with some pretty bad insults.\n\nEven though the younger men had not handled the situation very well, we wished them good night and told them to take care when we hopped off the bus. Relieved, we started walking towards a tram stop, waited for a bit, got on a tram and waited for it to leave. We both were lowkey scared as hell still but tried to brush it off. Then the worst case scenario happened. I saw the man walking towards the door of our tram. He got on, keeping an intense eyecontact with us. This man had followed us to the tram. It could've not been a coincidence because he entered so much later than us. He had noticed that we had left the bus and made the last minute decision to follow us.\n\nHe literally walked towards us fists clenched. I was sure he was going to hit me so I raised my hand to protect my head. He just stood there for a moment while I waited for the punch. Luckily, it never came. He sat down very close to us and started talking about how he would kill those men and that he knew where they live. With text messages, my friend and I decided to get off a stop earlier than we had planned to. \n\nOn the stop, we immediately started running until we reached a shady walkway where we could still see the stop. We stayed there silent for a moment until we where sure the man didn't also get off. After that we walked through the forest to make sure he couldn't find us anymore. Finally, we made it back safely to my friend's place. But holy hell was I scared.",

    "content": "Sometimes I think we may have been too eager to own a home. If we had taken our time and been more discerning, we probably would not have ended up as involuntary hosts to the dozens of yearly visitors that wander onto our property from the small business next door.\n\nWe live next to a funeral home. And by “next to”, I mean if our two buildings were any closer together they could be condensed into a townhouse. A small strip of yellowish-green grass barely wide enough to fit two people side-by-side is all that separates our properties, and evidently that strip belongs to my wife and me, because if we don’t mow it, it doesn’t get cut.\n\nReally I should say that we live *behind* a funeral home, because while it *is* our closest neighboring property on our left side, that side of our house is actually facing its rear. The funeral home is on the corner of our block, and its entrance is situated more or less perpendicular to our front door on the wall farthest from our house; the strange juxtaposition of our two buildings’ orientations is ugly and a little uncanny, but I suppose I can’t complain, because it means that I rarely have to see the funeral home’s clientele.\n\nOr at the very least, their *living* clientele.\n\nThe listing for our house didn’t say anything about it being next to a funeral home, and when we pulled up to view it, we were more than a little put off by the prospect of living next to a building that at any given time would most likely contain at least one dead person, but the price was right, and after months of bad luck with the housing market along with the expiration of our apartment lease quickly approaching, we jumped at the chance to finally have a place we could call our own. Besides, my wife and I both hold a fascination with all things paranormal and macabre (we spent our entire first date gushing over ghost shows and talking about the authenticity of various haunted objects), so after viewing the house and realizing that it had almost everything that we were looking for, we managed to convince ourselves that living next to such a strange, creepy building could actually be pretty cool. And to be fair, sometimes it actually is. Other times, however, it very much isn’t.\n\nOur house, at 109 years old, is definitely up there in age, but its interior was fully renovated a couple of decades before we moved in, so despite its mildly gothic exterior of gray, faded stone, arched windows, and sharp, multi-pointed roof, the inside is actually mostly semi-modern. All of the surrounding houses, including the funeral home, are even older than and are of a similar build to ours, and we quite frankly love the aesthetic that it gives the entire block. Autumns feel especially cozy, and the natural spookiness that our neighborhood exudes lends itself to making Halloween especially fun for the kids, as well as any horror enthusiasts like my wife and me who happen to live in the area. Most of the time we appreciate the overall vibe, but it certainly makes things even more eerie when our guests pay their unexpected visits.\n\nMr. Grayson, the owner and director of the funeral home, is a slightly strange, albeit decent enough guy. He, similar to his home, is getting up there in years, evidenced by his stark gray hair and wrinkly, pale skin, but judging by the naked ring finger on his left hand, he does not appear to be married, nor to even have anybody else living in the home with him.  He mostly keeps to himself, but he came by about a week after we had moved in to introduce himself to us. After exchanging pleasantries and partaking in a brief conversation, he steered the conversation to the business of… well, of his business. He said he hoped that living next to a funeral home wouldn’t bother us much, and that the positioning of the two houses would allow us to keep our privacy even when he hosted services. He told us that he didn’t provide cremations — that he preferred to do things the *old-school* way (whatever that meant) — so we wouldn’t have to worry about any unpleasant smells, and while he had a small parking lot attached to his property, often cars would wind up spilling out along the street, but servicegoers usually parked on the curb in front of his building and only rarely ventured into the space in front of our house. \n\nWe thanked him for the heads-up and said that it was nice to meet him. He turned to go, but he only made it to the middle step of our front porch before he turned back. “One more thing that I forgot to mention,” he said. “You may notice that my clients tend to… *wander*. At times they may briefly wander onto your property. You needn’t worry. They won’t harm you, and they will listen to you if you tell them to move on. I just thought I should forewarn you now before you find yourself positively spooked for no good reason.” He turned to leave again before we could respond. “Well, have a pleasant rest of your day. And don’t be a stranger, you hear? We’d love to have you over for dinner so we can welcome you to the neighborhood.”\n\nHe shuffled down our porch steps and made his way back to his home, disappearing inside and largely removing himself from our lives. Neither of us were particularly interested in his dinner invitation, and we doubted that he was either. Pleasantries, and all that.\n\nAt the time, we didn’t think much of Mr. Grayson’s final warning. We assumed that when he said “clients”, he was talking about disoriented mourners who sometimes wound up where they didn’t belong. We doubted that it would be a big deal, and so promptly forgot about it after a brief discussion about the strangeness of the whole encounter.\n\nThe first incident didn’t come until close to a month later. By then, we had largely forgotten about Mr. Grayson and his cryptic words of caution. We rarely even saw the funeral director outside of the occasional glimpse of him on his grandiose front porch welcoming mourners on service days, and the stress of the move had our minds very far away from our first interaction with the peculiar man.\n\nIt happened on a night in late spring; one of those hot, sweltering days that feel more like early summer despite what the calendar would have you believe. I woke up in the middle of the night desperately needing to pee, and seeing as our bedroom had never had a master bathroom installed during any of the house’s renovations, I was forced to walk out of our room and all the way down the long hallway to the lone second floor bathroom on the far end, hoping that my tired, lumbering footsteps didn’t wake my light sleeper of a wife. I didn’t turn the light on in the bathroom, so by the time I reached the toilet, did my business, and stepped back into the hallway, my eyes had properly adjusted to the darkness that enveloped me. Had I turned on the light, thus resetting my night vision, I might not have even noticed the little girl standing at the top of the staircase.\n\nShe couldn’t have been more than five or six years old. The first thing I noticed about her was that she was wearing a pink polka-dot bathing suit, which immediately struck me as odd for that time of night. The second was that she was positively soaking wet, her small frame weighed down by a heavy curtain of water that gave her clammy skin an unnatural shine and which forced her chestnut hair to cling to her little skull like a thin sheet of plastic wrap.  She stood staring at me from the shadows of the nighttime gloom, as still as death while droplets of water fell from her swim suit and weakly splashed against the hardwood floor at her feet. I immediately picked up on the overpowering scent of chlorine.\n\nHad this occurred only a few years later I may have thought she was my own daughter looking back at me from the shadows, but seeing as we did not yet have any children at the time of this incident, the girl’s presence completely baffled me. She stared at me with her pair of glassy, distant eyes for a few long seconds before I managed to chase away the surprise that kept me frozen in place.\n\n“Are you alright, little girl?” I asked her. No response. “Are… Are you lost?” Silence. “Where are your parents?”\n\nFor several moments I thought she wasn’t going to speak, until finally she found her words. “I… I don’t know.”\n\nHer voice was quiet, barely above a whisper, and while she was looking in my direction, I realized that she was not staring at *me*, but at a point *behind* me, as if I were not there at all.\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked her, but before I could get a response, I heard the sound of my wife shuffling out into the hallway. When she saw me, frozen stiff in the nighttime gloom, she frowned.\n\n“Who are you talking to?” she asked in her groggy, half-asleep voice. “And why does it smell like a pool out here?”\n\n“This little girl must be lost,” I said. “She says she doesn’t know—”\n\nIn the brief moment that I had turned to look at my wife, the girl had disappeared. For a while I stood completely still in the hallway, dumbfounded, at a loss for words. I may have convinced myself that I had imagined the entire encounter in my tired, sleep-deprived mind were it not for the pungent puddle of chlorinated water that still rested at the top of the stairs.\n\nWe immediately called 9-1-1, not because we were frightened of a little girl being somewhere in our house, but because we were concerned about her wellbeing. The police arrived fairly quickly, all things considered, and after asking a number of questions that I answered with varying degrees of confidence, they did a surprisingly curt search of our home that turned up no results. The girl was gone. Were it not for the puddle that she had left behind, I couldn’t have said for sure if she had even existed at all.\n\nI was stunned when one of the officers told me that while they would file a police report, there was nothing more they could do.\n\n“Nothing more you can *do*?” I said. “But there’s a lost little girl around here somewhere! You aren’t even going to ask around the neighborhood about her or something?”\n\nThe officer, looking like he had a lot to say, seemed to weigh his words before he finally sighed and spoke. “Look, you just moved into this place recently, right? Which means you probably don’t know this yet, but this isn’t the first call of this type that we’ve had at this residence. Not by a long shot.”\n\n“What, you mean like that girl has been here before?”\n\n“Not exactly,” the officer said. “People… tend to see strange things in this house. Things that aren’t necessarily there.”\n\n“But she left a puddle at the top of my stairs!” I said, flabbergasted. “It’s still sitting up there right now! You’re telling me I *imagined* that?”\n\n“No,” he said. “In fact, I’m sure you saw *something*, but I don’t know that it’s exactly what you might be thinking.” He paused, seeming to choose his next words carefully again. “Look, you’re the lieutenant's nephew, right? I think it’s probably more *his* place to explain this to you. Give him a call tomorrow morning and he’ll give you the skinny on this house. But in the meantime, rest easy tonight knowing that there is no lost little girl in a polka-dot bathing suit wandering around this neighborhood. Of that, I can assure you.”\n\nHis words were not at all reassuring.\n\nThe police left, and after cleaning up the puddle of water that was soaking into the hardwood of the upstairs landing, my wife and I went back to bed. My mind was too preoccupied by the thought of the lost little girl to fall back to sleep, so when morning came, I groggily crawled out of bed and followed that officer’s advice.\n\nMy uncle is, at the time of writing this, a nearly three-decade veteran of my town’s police department. He’s seen it all throughout the course of his career, including, apparently, personally going on several calls to my house back in the day, and so when I called him asking about the previous night’s incident, he immediately knew what I was talking about.\n\n“Geez,” he said from the other end of the line, “I didn’t realize that you had moved into *that* house. If I had, I probably would have told you to steer clear of it before you signed anything that was legally binding.”\n\nI frowned at this, despite knowing that he couldn’t see it. “Why? What exactly is wrong with our new house?”\n\nMy uncle waited a long time before answering — so long that I actually thought he had hung up on me or we had otherwise lost connection before he finally spoke again. “There is some… *weird* stuff that happens at that house, kid.”\n\n“I’ve already gathered as much,” I said, trying my best to check my annoyance while speaking to my uncle. “What I don’t understand yet is what exactly that means.”\n\nAgain there was an uncomfortably long pause. “Let me start by telling you this: the reason that officer last night knew that the little girl in the polka-dot bathing suit wasn’t wandering around your neighborhood is because he knew that she had died earlier this week.”\n\nI can still remember the chill that ran up my spine when my uncle told me this. The invisible line that connected our two phones suddenly felt very heavy, and only grew more dense with each passing moment of silence that followed. I knew that I needed to speak if I wanted to alleviate some of that weight. An exasperated “What?” was all I could muster.\n\n“Yeah,” he said, sounding sorry to have to be the one to tell me this. “She drowned during her swim lessons over the weekend. All of the adults in the pool were distracted with other students, and well… did you know that a person can drown in less than thirty seconds?”\n\nI hardly even heard my uncle’s drowning fact. For a few seconds, I didn’t even know what to say. “But how is that possible when I just saw her here last night?”\n\n“Without looking into it, I’m willing to bet she wound up at the funeral home next to your house.”\n\n“What makes you say that?”\n\n“Because the… *clients*… at that funeral home… they don’t like to stay *in* the funeral home. I can’t tell you how many calls we’ve gotten over the years of new homeowners seeing mysterious figures and uninvited guests in that house of yours, and each time we’ve looked into it, we’ve learned that the guests in question matched the description of recent arrivals at Grayson Funeral Home.”\n\n“What, you mean like they’re ghosts?” I said. “You’re not telling me the entire police department believes that, are you?”\n\n“It’s hard *not* to believe it with how many times it’s happened,” he said. “The facts don’t lie, and all I’m doing is telling you the facts.”\n\nI took a few moments to absorb this. “Okay, so assuming I believe you, what are we supposed to do now? Just live our lives in this house never knowing the next time we’re going to see another one of these ‘visitors’?”\n\n“There’s a reason so many people have moved in and out of that place over the years,” my uncle said. “Living with ghosts certainly isn’t for everybody. But you shouldn’t be in any sort of danger. As far as I know, the visitors don’t seem to mean any harm. They’re merely lost, confused, not yet able to accept that they’ve died. A little push in the right direction usually sees them on their way.”\n\n“*Usually*?”\n\n“Some of them might be a little more stubborn than others. We’ve definitely gotten calls about the same figures appearing over and over again in that house. But again, they don’t mean any harm. They just might inadvertently give you a fright every now and again.”\n\n“Right, like how that girl last night would have made me piss my pants had I not already taken care of my bladder a few moments beforehand,” I wanted to say. Instead I thanked  him for being a big help.\n\n“No problem, buddy,” he said. “And if you ever have any questions about the *people* you see, just give me a call. I might be able to dig something up about them that will set your mind at ease.”\n\nWhile I very much doubted that last statement, I appreciated my uncle’s offer anyway. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I would wind up relying on his insight a lot more than I ever would have expected.\n\nI told my wife what my uncle had told me. Being a paranormal buff, she was immediately accepting of the news, if not a little put off by it. She even seemed a little bit jealous that I had been the only one to see the girl; the only evidence she had of the spirit’s existence was the chlorinated puddle of water that had been left behind. She half-joked that she hoped she’d be the next one to see something paranormal, and acted as if that was for my sake, so she could “carry some of the burden” that our now home had bestowed upon us. It wouldn’t be long before she regretted this wish.\n\nAbout two weeks passed without incident. We settled back into our home with the new knowledge that my uncle had given us. On the outside not much had changed, but I could tell that we were both thinking about the little girl in the polka-dot bathing suit more than either of us wanted to admit. We talked about her a handful of times in those two weeks, more about who we thought she was in life than about our brief experience with her in death. The more we thought about her, the more upset we became over the tragic end of the little girl that we had never met and had not even known the name of. Eventually she would fade into the background, becoming just another number in the vast collection of visitors that we would gather throughout all of our years in this house, but for the time being her presence was very much felt, and it felt incredibly raw. We could understand why so many people had moved out of this house throughout the decades. Even as paranormal enthusiasts, the weight of what we had experienced was significant, and we could only imagine how heavy it felt for others who wanted nothing to do with the ghostly interlopers that regularly found their way onto our property. And all of this was after only a single experience.\n\nBut there were certainly many more to come.\n\nAt the expiration of those two weeks, I heard my wife scream. I was cooking pasta in the kitchen, the hot pot in my mitted hands headed toward the strainer in the sink, when her terrified screech stabbed through the house like a stiletto, so shrill and horrific that I nearly scalded myself with the boiling water. I placed the pot back on the stove with as much haste as I dared to and rushed toward the sound of her voice, calling her name and asking her if she was alright as I went. I found her in the second floor bathroom, sitting curled up in the tub and sobbing so hard that I thought she was going to cause herself to asphyxiate right there beneath the dripping faucet. After crawling into the tub with her and comforting her for a minute or so, I managed to get her calm enough that she could tell me what had forced her into such a state.\n\nShe had been cleaning the bathroom sink, her eyes focused on the bowl as she went to town with her trusty scrub brush, when she happened to look up into the mirror. Standing behind her, staring into the mirror, was a shirtless, middle-aged man, his face caked in a sickening mixture of shaving cream and blood. More of the red hot liquid spurted from a deep, long wound in his throat, and she swore she could feel the blood’s sticky warmth splashing against the back of her neck. When she turned around he was already gone, but that didn’t stop the banshee-like shriek from forcing its way out of her. She didn’t remember climbing into the bathtub, but she must have raced toward it with primal expedience, where she then coiled up in fear until I arrived.\n\nWe stayed in the tub for a long time after that while she battled with her lungs to regain control of her breathing. Eventually I helped her shaking, weak form climb out of the tub and walked her to our bedroom, where she rested for a while afterwards. No longer in the mood to eat, I threw my pasta in the trash and returned to the bathroom, where I finished her chores for her. While cleaning the sink, I noticed a small splotch of white shaving cream smeared upon the counter, which I promptly wiped away. I somehow managed to convince myself that it had been my own shaving cream, despite the fact that I had been growing a beard at the time and hadn’t used the stuff in months.\n\nI reluctantly asked my uncle about this incident, and what he told me disturbed me enough that I decided I would not repeat it to my wife unless she asked me about it. To this day, she never has. My uncle told me that the man in question had recently been murdered by his wife. She had come up behind him while he was shaving, one of his old-school double-edged razor blades hidden in her hand. She sliced open his throat before he even had a chance to realize what was happening. Now she was sitting in the local jail while he was in the funeral home next door, waiting to be put to rest by his confused and devastated family. At the time, his wife had not provided a motive for the murder, and I never followed up with my uncle about it. I didn’t see much good in knowing.\n\nNaturally, we discussed moving out after this. Oddly enough, my wife was the one who was more intent on staying in the house, despite her experience being significantly worse than mine was.\n\n“We’ve made a commitment to this house,” she said, “and we’re going to stick to it. There’s no way we can let this place beat us that easily.” She forced a smile. “Besides, both Mr. Grayson and your uncle said we don’t have anything to worry about with these visitors. It’s not like they can hurt us or anything.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, “but they can scare you so badly that you wind up hiding in the bath tub.”\n\n“I was more surprised than anything else. I’m sure I won’t react nearly that badly next time.” My wife placed a reassuring hand on my forearm. “You don’t need to worry about me. I’ll be alright.”\n\n“Are you sure?” I asked, unconvinced.\n\nShe nodded. “Yeah. I can handle a few scares here and there if you can.”\n\nI finally gave a smile back to her. It was mostly genuine. “Of course I can. It’s going to take more than a few unexpected guests to scare me out of this place.”\n\nAnd so we were in agreement, and the matter was settled. \n\nYears passed in that house. We raised a family together: a pair of beautiful daughters that became our entire world. All the while, we continued to be inconvenienced by our regular visitors. Sometimes weeks would go by where nothing paranormal happened, but other times we’d both have experiences for multiple days in a row. As it turned out, my wife had been right: she had never had as bad of a reaction as the one after her first incident. Some ghostly encounters were worse than others, but never once had we ever felt threatened by any of the presences in our home — or at least not for a while, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself. We eventually mustered the bravery to do as Mr. Grayson and my uncle had told us to, and encouraged any guests we encountered to leave. Like my uncle said, there were a few that ignored our urges and stuck around for a while after we had spoken to them, but most of them didn’t put up a fight. The good ones did as we instructed, usually disappearing with such little fuss that it often took us a little while to even realize that they had left.\n\nAs our two daughters grew up, we taught them how to deal with the apparitions they encountered, and soon they would even begin telling us stories about the ghosts they “vanquished” throughout the house. My youngest once encountered an elderly woman in our garden when she was gathering peppers for her mother, and on the same day our oldest came across a young boy around her age while she was pulling her bike out of the shed. Both of them encouraged the interlopers to move on, and both guests had listened without any complaint. I was oddly proud of my girls; it felt as if they had taken up the mantle of some old family tradition, and were following in the well-trodden footsteps of their ancestors before them. Their experiences at home made them tough and difficult to frighten, and they eventually became minor celebrities at their school. Kids started coming over wanting to have paranormal experiences, and a few of them even did, or so they said. I suppose I’ll never really know if they were being honest about their encounters, or if they were simply making up stories to tell their friends on the playground. But I guess it doesn’t really matter.\n\nNot every visitor was the result of a recent death. As I said before, the funeral home is quite old, and some of its patrons over the decades and even centuries have chosen to stick around for much longer than they ever should have. Once I was working under the hood of my car in the garage when I suddenly smelled cigarette smoke. I looked up and saw a man standing in front of my work bench, a lit cigarette drooping lazily in his mouth. He wore a white T-shirt tucked into a pair of dark blue jeans which were themselves cuffed overtop his pair of worn work boots. His black hair was sturdily slicked back and held in place with what looked to be a strong pomade, and was so dark and shiny that it was difficult to make out the thick layer of blood that caked the crown of his head. He was studying the bench, his arms planted against its surface, his profile facing me.\n\n“Looking for something?” I asked.\n\nHe didn’t turn to look at me when he responded. “You seen the monkey wrench, boss?”\n\n“No,” I said, “and I think you ought to leave.”\n\n“Oh,” he said. “Awright, then.”\n\nI returned my attention to my car, and when I looked in his direction again, he was gone. The smell of his burning cigarette lingered in the garage for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nThere was a time one summer when my wife and I had some of our college friends over for a cookout. We had warned them that they might encounter one of our regular guests during their visit, but they all laughed it off and didn’t think much of it. At night we spent a few hours around a campfire in our backyard swapping stories, playing games, and just generally enjoying each other's company. The group initially consisted of five of us — my wife and me, along with our three friends — but at a point that I could not and I *still* cannot discern, our number increased to six. \n\nMy wife was the first to notice him sitting in an empty space between two of our friends, and she subtly drew everybody’s attention to him. In the uneven light of the guttering fire, we could see his messy brown beard and matching hair beneath his brimmed Hardee hat, as well as the Prussian blue jacket that adorned his upper body. I saw rather quickly that the area around his abdomen was significantly darker than the rest of his upper body, and in the light of the flame, I could just barely make out that the jacket had been torn to shreds there. Our friends, too frightened to move, could only watch as the man in blue sitting between them leaned forward, pulled a metal flask from his hip, and began to drink. The scent of whiskey cut through the burn of the campfire and drifted on the nighttime summer air as he drank, and in a few moments the liquor that found its way to his stomach came pouring out of the tattered hole in his coat.\n\nThe blue man slowly turned his head toward our friend, seeming to notice her for the first time. He raised the flask in his hand, presenting it to her. “Care for some?”\n\nOur friend, despite our earlier warning, was too petrified to respond, and so my wife spoke in her place. “No, thank you. And I think it best that you move on.”\n\nThe blue man capped his flask, then followed up with a lethargic tip of his hat directed at nobody in particular. “Alright.”\n\nHe went silent and turned his attention to the fire. The living members of our group did our best to carry on with the conversation as if he wasn’t there, and eventually one of us noticed that our number had once again been reduced to five. But the smell of whiskey remained for some time, and an inspection of the ground near where the blue man sat revealed that the dirt was wet with the jettisoned contents of his ruined stomach.\n\nOur friends stopped making fun of our ghost stories after that. None of them have visited our home since then.\n\nConsidering the age of the funeral home, I didn’t think we’d ever have a guest that was older than the blue man, so you can imagine my surprise and confusion when only a few months later I encountered a Roman Centurion with a bruised, swollen forehead in our basement. More baffling still was the fact that he spoke to me in English, and understood me when I told him it was time for him to leave. Everything made a lot more sense when my uncle informed me that an especially intoxicated man had recently fallen to his death from a fourth-floor balcony during a Halloween party. He had apparently hit his head pretty hard when he landed.\n\nIt is important to reiterate that all of the visitors mentioned up to this point never made any of us feel unsafe outside of the occasional initial reaction of surprise or fright (and even then, the occurrences became so frequent that we weren’t even startled by our guests half the time anymore). Any fear instilled in us faded not long after the visitors left, and the only returning guests we’ve had are the ones we failed to make leave during our first few encounters with them, but even these have all eventually passed on just the same as their predecessors had. This is all to say that not once have we ever experienced a presence in our home that we have not been able to handle.\n\nAt least not until *that* night.\n\nIt happened the winter after our oldest daughter’s first birthday. My wife had to stay late at work, which wasn’t unheard of, especially back in those days. On nights like those, I’d handle getting our 1-year-old settled into bed before drifting off to sleep myself shortly after, but I’d always leave a few lights on for when my wife got home, one of them being the wall lamp in the upstairs hallway. I had just gotten our daughter to fall asleep and was in our bedroom, reading a book in bed while preparing to hit the hay, when I happened to look toward the open bedroom door and saw the apparition standing there. She was a little girl, similar in age to that first spirit I had seen standing at the top of the stairs all those years ago. Immediately upon seeing her I knew that something was wrong.\n\nHer presence brought with it a disturbing chill that was uncharacteristic of any other spirits we’d encountered up to that point (plenty of them had come with strange feelings or auras that sometimes manipulated the temperatures in the room, but none of them had ever had this level of intensity to them). It made all the hairs on my body stand up as if they had suddenly been frozen into an army of needling icicles. As we stared at each other, her in the doorway and me in the bed, I felt an overwhelming sense of terror latch onto me that I had never experienced before, and hopefully will never experience again.\n\nThe hallway behind her was black with an almighty darkness, which I knew should not have been possible, since I had left the light on for my wife, and I had seen its soft glow streaming into the room out of the corner of my eye while I was reading my book. As I noticed this powerful umbra, I realized that the overwhelming energy I felt was not coming from the girl, but rather from the presence that existed in the space beyond which light could reach. And as the understanding of a fresh, terrible danger continued to bubble up within me, something happened that stood in complete contrast to every ghostly encounter that I had experienced up to that point: the girl was the one to tell me that she needed to leave.\n\nAnd I knew that I needed to stop her from doing so.\n\nSomething in my gut told me that whatever presence existed in the void beyond the doorway was beckoning for the girl to come to it, and I knew that I couldn’t allow that to happen. I knew that for her to listen to that dreadful umbra would only result in her eternal doom. I was the only thing that stood between her and the certain damnation that awaited her just beyond the edge of that cataclysmic precipice.\n\n“No, I think you should stay here for a while,” I said to her, sitting up in my bed. I planted my bare feet on the chilly hardwood floor. Its cold touch steeled my nerves, and fought back the cacophony of voices in my mind that screamed for me to let her leave, let the umbra have her just so long as it would leave me alone.\n\nShe seemed confused, or at least as confused as a ghost could be. “Are you sure? I really think I should leave now.”\n\nHer voice sounded small, distant, and vulnerable, which only made me all the more protective of her.\n\n“I’m sure,” I said. “Stay in this house for a bit, okay? You can even go play in my daughter’s room for a little while. You’ll like it in there. It’s cozy, with lots of toys and big, soft pillows.”\n\n“I don’t know,” she said, turning to look through the doorway toward the darkness. “My friend says he’s going to take me to my parents. He says they’re looking for me.”\n\n“Don’t listen to him,” I said. “He’s a stranger. You shouldn’t talk to strangers.”\n\nShe paused, as if hearing somebody speak. “He says that *you’re* a stranger.”\n\n“I know your parents,” I said. It felt wrong to lie to her like that, but I knew I had to do anything I could to stop her from going with the presence in the hallway. “They’ll come to get you soon. But you have to stay here, okay?”\n\nThe girl remained silent for a long time while I barely so much as breathed from my spot on the bed. The room grew heavier, darker, and I found that my lungs soon struggled to take in air, as if they were freshly recovering from running a marathon. My forehead grew slick with sweat despite the chill that infested the room. My body began to burn and ache. Paradoxically, rather than escape the heat I felt the almost uncontrollable need to crawl beneath the warm, safe covers and hide from the powerful umbra that seemed to be slowly sweeping into the room in the form of long, black, shadowy tendrils.\n\nI suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of defeat. I feared that the girl was going to follow the presence, and that she would quickly be lost to the unending darkness that so sweetly coaxed her from such an agonizingly short distance away. But soon I noticed that the dark presence was beginning to recede, until finally the light in the hallway was able to once again pierce through the weakening gloom. The terrible chill fled from the room, and the dense miasma that had been suffocating me and draining the very will to live from my bones faded back into light, breathable air.\n\n“Okay,” she said. “I’ll stay.”\n\n“Good,” I said. “And let me know if *he* tries to talk to you again, okay?”\n\n“Okay,” she said again.\n\nThe girl stood staring at me for a spell while my nerves continued to strum all along my anxious body like a mass of broken guitar strings. Reaching a shaking hand toward my nightstand, I picked up my book and forced myself to return to my reading in an attempt to calm myself down. When my body was once again my own, I looked back at the doorway. The girl was gone, and gentle lamplight bled in from the hall. Strangely enough, I was no longer worried for her. I somehow understood that whatever presence had wanted her had been thwarted that night, and that she was safe for the time being. This truth was confirmed to me when I saw her again a few weeks later, and, with the umbratic presence absent, I finally told her that it was time for her to move on. When she vanished for the last time, I felt an inexplicable peace overwhelm me, and I started to cry.\n\nTo this day I don’t know the extent of what the umbra wanted with the girl, but I know now as I did back then that its intentions were nothing short of sinister. I still wonder what had caused that presence to specifically latch onto her instead of the countless other souls that drifted through our home, but I could never muster the courage to research the entity or ask my uncle for more details about the girl’s death. I debated not even telling my wife about this encounter, but ultimately decided that she needed to know. I stayed up until she got home that night, much to her confusion, and immediately told her what had happened. She remained quiet for a long while after that. Neither of us slept that night.\n\nIt has been the better part of two decades since that incident. My youngest daughter just started high school, and my uncle retired from the police service going on five years ago now. Mr. Grayson still holds his funeral services next door — I saw him outside welcoming mourners just last week — and I try not to think about the fact that the old man looks like he hasn’t aged a day since I met him.\n\nCountless guests have come and gone in the years since that terrible night, but that dark presence has not returned. I don’t know if it ever will, and I pray to God that I never have to feel what I felt that night again. More than that, though, I pray that my wife and daughters never have to experience what I went through on that night. If that shadow decides to show itself again, I just ask that it does so to me, and to me alone. Because I’ll be here, waiting for it, should it ever choose to make itself known. \n\nI already know that I’m going to spend the rest of my life in this house, ghosts and all. If they couldn’t scare me away in those first few months, then they’re stuck with me until the time comes that I join their ranks on the other side of that thin, translucent veil that we call death. And who knows? Maybe I’ll wind up in the funeral home next door when my time finally comes, and I’ll have the chance to pay this old house one last visit before I say goodbye.",

    "content": "**Do not go to the thrift store called Hidden Gems.**  \nI need to start with that, because if anyone finds this, they’ll understand why. \n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oa8dx8/im_an_er_nurse_and_after_last_night_i_have_proof/)\n\nEvil is so much worse than I initially thought. It’s not chaos or fire, it’s order. Purpose. It serves a function. The only reason I went to Hidden Gems is because of Hannah.  \n\nI didn’t believe in ghosts, an afterlife, or any of that until Emma happened. The words that hissed from her mouth, “I can help you talk to Hannah again,” bounced around my skull as I sat behind my steering wheel, frozen, trying to decide what to do next.\n\nAnd those words are what pushed me to go back inside the ER and talk to her. \n\nI walked back in and, after a few moments, noticed a faint humming. Amid the noise and movement, someone was humming *Frère Jacques*. I looked around, but no one was facing me. Still, the tune lingered in the air, faint and off-key, like a broken music box playing in my head.\n\nOut of context, that song might not mean anything to you. But it’s the song that Hannah’s dad used to sing to her when she was a baby. \n\nI kept on toward Emma’s room. The closer I got, the louder the humming grew, needling into my skull. I turned the corner into her room and Emma’s eyes met mine. She sat upright,  perfectly still, her gaze fixed on me. “Ryan’s planning on burning the jacket. He’s buying lighter fluid right now.”\n\n“How do you know that?” I asked.\n\nMy phone rang, no number, no name, a blank screen. But it was ringing. \n\n“Answer it,” she instructed.\n\nI lifted the phone to my ear and Emma’s voice came through the line. She was talking to Ryan. Her words projecting from the phone, but her mouth never moved. She sat right in front of me, perfectly still, staring at me as her voice spilled out from the speaker.\n\nI shouted into the phone, demanding Ryan tell me where he was. “He can’t hear you,” she raised her voice above mine as their conversation continued through the phone. “Be quiet and listen.” \n\n“Drop the lighter fluid.\" She told him.\n\n“Why should I listen to you?” Ryan’s voice crackled through the speaker.\n\nA deep, uneven laugh crawled through the speaker. Emma’s voice cracked, and then shifted, older now, rougher; it wasn’t hers anymore “If you burn the jacket,” an Old Man said, his voice deep and craggy, “Emma burns.” \n\nRyan went quiet, I could only hear him faintly breathing on the other end. “Who are you?” he said weakly. Then the phone cut out.\n\n“He won’t try and burn it now,” Emma said in her normal voice. She smiled, and her face folded strangely, as if someone else were wearing a mask of her.\n\nI stood there, a dozen questions lodged in my throat. I asked anyway, “Where is the jacket from?” And, “What do you mean I’ll talk to Hannah again?”\n\n“It’s from a thrift store,” Emma said “Hidden Gems. Not far from here.” \n\nThen she leaned forward, the restraints binding her to the bed taut, catching her against her own weight. “Put the jacket on, don’t fight it,” she rasped, “and you’ll see her again.” She stayed in place, her stare pinned me where I stood. \n\nThe sterile white lights above flickered wildly. The heart monitor crackled and screamed static. Inbetween the burst of lights I saw Emma changing. One moment, Emma. The next, an Old Man. His skin looked wet, riddled with gooey open sores. Folds of flesh hung loose on his face, like a snake shedding its skin. The sour metallic stench of decay filled the air and my stomach churned. With every flicker of the light, she switched back and forth until the room went dark.\n\nThere was a few seconds of silence, then I realized someone was right next to me, breathing in my ear, I felt their hot breath on my face. I jumped as the lights flickered back on. Emma was in the bed, her restraints still taut against her wrists. Hidden Gems. That’s where I had to go.\n\n—\n\nThe overhead bell stretched through the impossibly quiet thrift store when I stepped inside. No one in sight. “Hello?” I called out. \n\nI took a few more steps in. Whispering drifted through the air. I froze, scanning the aisles. The words were too soft to catch, slipping through like wind between walls. “Hello?” I called again. \n\nSomeone was watching me. I could feel them. I turned slowly, checking every direction. No one.\n\nThen another faint whisper drifted through the aisles.\n\nI continued on. The scent of stale mildew and old clothes hung in the air. I stopped at a pair of shoes. A white tag, hanging from them caught my eye. Scrawled in black sharpie on the tag: “William: 10/21/21”. \n\nRight then something moved on the clothing rack across from me. I caught a glimpse of what looked like a shadow between the clothes.\n\n“Can I help you?” I jumped and spun around. A lady stood behind the front counter where no one had been moments before. It was odd, unsettling, but she was smiling at me and looked pleasant enough.\n\nI told her a half-truth, coming up with the best story I could: that Emma had been in recently, and that she’d gone to the hospital because something about a jacket had made her sick.\n\n“Oh,” she said. She asked me my name and introduced herself as Agatha. \n\n“Do you remember selling it?” I asked. \n\n“A jacket made her sick?” She seemed very skeptical.\n\n“Yes,” I said. Holding her gaze.\n\nShe reached for a long overcoat hanging nearby and walked toward me. “That sounds pretty unbelievable, if you ask me.” Before I could respond, she draped the heavy coat over my shoulders. “Feel sick yet?” she teased.\n\nThen the coat tightened. A faint vibration rippled across my chest. Agatha’s expression changed. Her lip curled, exposing brown rotting teeth, something I hadn’t noticed before.\n\nThe thrift store lights dimmed, their steady hum slipping into a low, pulsing rhythm, like a heartbeat echoing through the walls. \n\nThe coat constricted, clinging tighter, as if it were alive. My skin began to burn, as though sandpaper were grinding against it. I screamed for help, but Agatha didn’t move. She just watched.\n\nI blinked and the store was gone. \n\nIn its place: a narrow hallway, walls yellowed and peeling. I had been transported somewhere, somehow. \n\nI immediately heard faint cries nearby. I started toward the sound. I thought to myself, *I should stop*. But my legs wouldn’t obey. My mind screamed to stop, but my body moved on. It was as though my body and mind were disconnected. I was like a puppet on a string.\n\nAs I passed a mirror, I caught my reflection. My stomach dropped. It wasn’t my reflection looking back at me, but a man I didn’t recognize. The only familiar thing was the overcoat Agatha had put on me.\n\nI continued on against my own will. I turned the corner where the cries were coming from and froze.\n\nA man was standing over a woman, his hands clenched around a butchers knife. He brought it down again and again into her chest, the sound dull and wet, like a shovel striking mud.\n\nI wanted to scream, to run, but I couldn’t. My feet were rooted to the spot.\n\nThen the man stopped and lifted his head. No face. Just smooth featureless skin where features should have been, like someone had erased them. Even without eyes, I could feel him staring at me. I stumbled back, trying to get away. But before I could, he was on me. The knife swung upward, driving into my jaw. A rush of heat and pain flooded through me.\n\nThe lights flickered and I was suddenly back in the thrift store, trembling on the ground as I ripped the overcoat off. My skin stung as I yanked it away from my body.\n\nAgatha stared down at me, mocking me she said, “So the jacket made her sick?”\n\nI frantically felt my jaw, searching for the wound. \n\n“That death wasn’t yours,” Agatha said. She picked the overcoat off the ground and read aloud. “It was Michael’s.” She turned the tag around for me to see: “Michael: 06/21/71”\n\n“What was that? What’s happening?” I was terrified and confused.\n\n“Thank God you got it off in time, otherwise it would’ve bound itself to you.”\n\nA fierce burn ran across my chest. I lifted up my shirt and my skin was scraped raw in several places.\n\n“These clothes need a new home. I’m here to facilitate a way for them to live on.” She continued, “None of them are priced. They're tagged with names and dates. Just as Emma’s jacket was.” A chill washed over me. \n\n“Why is this happening?” I asked. \n\n“Because it does,” she said simply. “It doesn’t have to involve you. But I think you want it to.”\n\nMaybe I didn’t need Emma’s jacket, maybe I just needed Agatha. “Can you help me see Hannah again?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“But the Old Man told me he could,” I said.  \n\n“Well then that’s the deal he made with you. I don’t make the decisions, I balance the books.”\n\nHer eyes stayed fixed on me, like she was staring into my very being. I felt her inside my head, wading through my thoughts like cold water rushing into my skull.\n\n“If you want to know who’s responsible for her death, he can show you that too.”\n\nIt’s hard for me to talk about this. But I should. It’s what led me here. Hannah was killed in a hit-and-run. She went for a jog and never came back. They never found the car. Whoever did it got away with murder. This could be my chance to find them.\n\nThat’s when my phone rang. No number, no name, but it was ringing. I answered and *Frère Jacques* hummed faintly on the other end. “Ryan’s at home now,” The Old Man’s craggy voice whispered. He gave me the address. “Go. Before it’s too late.”\n\nAnd I did. \n\nI can’t tell you the rest of what happened. Not here. But what I can say is that none of this is my fault. It was self defense. And everything I’ve done, everything I’m going to do, is for Hannah. \n\nWhat I will tell you is this: I have the jacket now.",

    "content": "Mark asked me excitedly. I had.\n\n “Total lunar eclipse this Friday.”\n\nHis perverse excitement irked me, but I had known he’d always been fascinated by it throughout our marriage.\n\n“I talked to Steve about it today,” he said, lowering his voice as if savoring the words. “He told me they’ve known for a while, astrological calendar or something. Steve’s been tracking it at the station. Had someone at the school told you?”\n\n“Yes,” I lied.\n\n“You should have told me!” His irritation sharpened, then softened into something almost gleeful. After a beat of silence, he asked,\n\n“How many do you think he’ll kill this year?”\n\nI drew a breath, forcing myself to steady the irritation in my voice.\n\n “I don’t know, Mark. You know I don’t like to talk about it.”\n\nBut the numbers clawed their way back, unbidden. Everyone in town knew them.\n\n Tuesday, July 6th, 1982, one killed.\n\n Thursday, December 30th, that same year, one more.\n\n Thursday, August 17th, 1989, four.\n\n Wednesday, December 9th, 1992, another four.\n\n Monday, November 29th, 1993, four again. \n\n And just this spring, Wednesday, April 3rd, 1996, six gone.\n\nTwenty bodies in Amherst. No, I did not like to think about it.\n\n“More than last time, I’d imagine,” I said at last, if only to placate him.\n\n“Honey,” Mark’s voice lifted with a strange, eager brightness, “Steve says they’re certain they’ll catch him this time.”\n\nIt wasn’t the first time the police thought they were closing in on their killer.  \n“They’ve said that before,” I reminded him.\n\n“I know,” Mark rushed, excitement rising. “But Steve, he couldn’t give me details, you know, cop stuff, but he swears it’s different this time!”\n\nSteve was a good man and meant well for a cop, but half the time, he didn’t know his ass from his elbow.  \n“I hope he’s right,” I said, though I didn’t believe it.\n\nThe first killing had shaken the town to its core. Wednesday, July 7th: an early morning jogger stumbled across the mangled body of Michael Strong, a 16-year-old delinquent, along the banks of Puffer’s Pond. His throat had been slashed so deep his head was nearly severed. The sheer brutality suggested someone who knew him. One of his mother’s revolving boyfriends was hauled in, questioned, and just as quickly cut loose.\n\nThe town was buzzing that summer, the summer after Mark and I graduated. Our relationship had only just begun. He’d been terrified I’d meet someone else at school that fall. Then the murder happened, and he was horrified, yet unable to look away. After all, his younger brother had gone to school with Michael Strong.\n\n“Me too, really want to see the monster who could be doing this.” He paused. “The bus is here.”\n\n“Tell Shar I love her.”\n\n“Will do. Love you.”\n\n“Love you too. I’ll see you tonight.”\n\nIt was hard to believe Sharon was already seven. August 2nd, 1989, still the hardest day of my life. Nine hours of labor, each contraction a tidal wave tearing through me. I remember clutching Mark’s hand so tightly my nails left crescents in his skin, his voice steadying me through the pain. And then, at last, her cry split the air, sharp, fierce, alive. The nurse laid her on my chest, warm and squirming, and Mark’s eyes brimmed with tears as if he’d never seen anything so perfect.\n\nMark had always wanted a baby. I made him wait, first my undergraduate, then my master’s. We married in the middle, his plumbing jobs keeping us afloat while I scraped for lab grants that always came too late. When I finally told him we could try, the joy in his face was something I’ll never forget. And Sharon, our Sharon, was the greatest gift we’d ever been given.\n\nJust over two weeks later, four students were butchered on campus.\n\nAugust 17th, 1989, the night of freshman orientation. Someone had slipped through an unlocked window on the first floor of Baker House, in and out, quick as a shadow. The girls, Lisa Rathbone, Shannon Armstrong, Tracy Lloyd, and Denise Derwick, had left the latch undone. It was enough.\n\nThe killer started with Lisa and Denise, crushing their skulls with a hammer before the others even stirred. By the time Shannon and Tracy woke to the sound of hammer squelching brain, it was already too late. Their screams tore through the dorm, echoing down the hallways, but the orientation chaos and the lunar eclipse that had drawn so many students outside kept help from coming.\n\nBy the time anyone forced the door, the room was a slaughterhouse. Lisa and Denise lay unrecognizable. Shannon wasn’t in much better of a state. Tracy was still alive, barely, her body twitching as she slipped into a coma she would never wake from.\n\nMark was horrified. And me, if it hadn’t been for the pregnancy, I might have been there that night, working.\n\nThat was the first time anyone began whispering about the pattern, how it might not be a coincidence at all.\n\nMichael Strong’s murder, and then Chelsea Murphy’s that December, had rattled the town. Both were brutal, senseless killings in a place that prided itself on safety. But they were treated as isolated tragedies, the kind of horror that struck once a generation. No one, at least not openly, spoke of the fact that both deaths had fallen on nights of a lunar eclipse.\n\nMark would later claim that after Murphy’s murder, he knew the killer only struck beneath an eclipse. But I knew he was lying. He hadn’t seen it. I had. I recognized it immediately, though I never told him.\n\nTo his credit, after the second murder, he was quick to call it what it was: a serial killer. It was the early ’80s, though, and every brutal crime was a serial killer’s work, until months passed, then years, and the fear dulled. Even Mark let it slip from his mind.\n\nUntil 89, then everything shifted. I rolled my chair back, opened the bottom drawer of my file cabinet, and the astrological calendar peered up at me;  Friday, September 27th. The paper smelled faintly of dust and old coffee, the corners softened from years of being thumbed.\n\nIt hadn’t been a coincidence that Michael Strong and Chelsea Murphy were killed under lunar eclipses. Full eclipses that crossed over Amherst coincided with killings; eclipses that missed the town did not. Partial eclipses produced nothing. For a while, I let doubt creep in; maybe I’d been seeing patterns where none existed. Then Baker House. And now, September 27th glared back at me from the calendar, heavy as an omen. That old feeling twisted, stirring in my stomach. I swallowed hard, trying to push it down and to steady myself.\n\n’89 had been the year I began my doctorate, and the year panic swept the University. Security patrols doubled, curfews were enforced, and dorm windows were nailed shut. The campus they called “the Zoo,” fell silent. Thank God for our parents, whose babysitting let me return to the lab, and for Mark, by then a newly minted master plumber, who threw himself into work.\n\nWhen the school year ended without another attack, a memorial plaque was set in the ground outside Baker Hall. By the following year, the speeches grew shorter, the vigil crowds smaller, the memories dimmer. And by December of 1992, the murders had been all but forgotten.\n\nBy then, I was teaching 100-level classes to rooms of glassy-eyed underclassmen. Finals were looming, the holidays hung in the air, and even after a lifetime in this town, the sight of it dressed for Christmas could still coax a smile from me, yes, even that December. The bricks glowed warm against the cold, lanterns burned in the town center, and campus lawns sprouted Christmas trees and snowmen.\n\nWe’d only been in our first house since February, but Mark made that first Christmas there feel enchanted. It was the kind of calm that settles in just before January and February bury the town beneath snowdrifts higher than windows, the wind cutting sharp at ten below.\n\nMy students, out-of-staters, internationals, and Eastern Mass kids alike, chattered with wide-eyed excitement about the coming lunar eclipse, calling it a Christmas miracle. I smiled and let them. I didn’t have the heart to tell them what it really meant.\n\nI was grateful that none of my students were killed. None from the University, at all.\n\nWednesday, December 9th: four Amherst College students had been laughing amidst a snowball fight on East Drive when the shooter struck. Jamal Naveer, Elizabeth Hawkins, and Dorothy Freeman went down instantly, gunned down with precision no amateur could manage. Jacob Donnelly ran. The shooter clipped his shoulder, dropped him in the snow, and, while he begged and pleaded, put a final round in his head, execution-style.\n\nIt had stopped snowing earlier that afternoon. Steve, by then on the force, told Mark that if the flakes had kept falling, they might’ve been able to track the tires. Horse shit, if you ask me. Steve was working a desk, not homicide. What they did have were seven shell casings, all .45s from a Colt M1911.\n\nThe manhunt exploded. The press gave the killer a name, the “Blood Moon Killer.” I don’t know who coined it, but it stuck, spreading like wildfire. Police began dragging in every Amherst resident who owned a .45, interrogating veterans, burning through leads.\n\nAnd then, just after New Year’s, the whole of UMass reeled when Professor Ian Lowe was arrested. A veteran, his service pistol conveniently missing, his wife refusing to confirm his alibi. Mark was stunned; we’d eaten dinner at Lowe’s house just weeks before, over Thanksgiving. He tried to save face by insisting Lowe had always rubbed him the wrong way. Attractive men often did.\n\nThe trial began that June, a full-blown circus. Reporters flooded Hampshire District Court; Western Mass had never seen anything like it. The police, the prosecution, the whole community believed they had their man. Lowe had lived in Amherst since ’78. He was large, fit, a veteran. His gun was gone. He couldn’t explain that away. They tried to tie all ten murders to him. The details that didn’t fit, that he wasn’t in Amherst on July 6th, 1982, that he couldn’t possibly have squeezed through Baker House’s window, were conveniently left unspoken.\n\nI still remember the broadcast in September. Sharon was playing with Mark on the carpet as I watched the news. The defense had introduced a new witness, Graduate Student Kelly Horan. I knew her. I knew about her relationship with Lowe. I knew about his relationships with TAs, with staff, with anyone who batted an eye his way. It didn’t take long before the prosecution’s case started to fray.\n\nBut as November neared and the next anticipated lunar eclipse approached, the town held its breath. One way or another, we would find out whether the Blood Moon Killer was already in custody or still at large.\n\nMonday, November 29th, 1993, the moon had darkened to the deepest shade I had ever seen. “Blood moon” is a misnomer; it is usually a dull orange. But that night it was nearly red, glowing like a burning coal as I drove home beneath it. People said the eclipse lasted an hour. In truth, it was 46.7 minutes.\n\nWhen I walked in, Mark told me the news: four more dead. Two students had been killed just off the north of campus near Fairfield Street, out under the sky, watching the moon: Riley Tomkins and Sarah Jacobs.\n\nRiley had taken a knife to the back of her throat, the blade driven deep enough to push through where her Adam's Apple had been. Sarah had made an awful scream as she ran, but she was silenced by a single round from a Colt .45. The bullet punched in just at the juncture of neck and shoulder, tearing through muscle, artery, and bone. It should have killed her. It did not. The killer finished the work by stomping her skull.\n\nA neighbor, fifty-six-year-old Ken Williams, had heard the shot and stepped outside with his own revolver, hoping to help. Instead, he came upon the killer scraping brain matter from the soles of their boots on the curb. Ken took a single shot above the left eye. He dropped instantly.\n\nThe killer then drifted back toward the University. Graduate student Li Xiu had just left the life sciences lab. He did not run. He took a bullet to the chest, dropped where he stood, and never rose again.\n\nMark had been horrified. How could he not? I worked right there.  \nI was horrified, too, though for a different reason. I had known Li Xiu. He had been an exceptional student: quiet, precise, courteous, his work in the lab meticulous.\n\nProfessor Lowe was released soon after, his marriage dissolved, and he moved far from Amherst. The town barely whispered his name again.\n\nSteve told Mark the rest one night over beers at our kitchen table, while I strained my ears from the other room. The CCTV footage had caught a little, but not enough: Li Xiu pausing outside the life sciences building, waving at someone off camera, then lowering his hand in confusion a split second before the shot punched through his chest.\n\nSteve admitted that he believed the killer was a student. There had been no real suspects, no trail to follow, just a body on the pavement, a half-wave frozen in time, and a single .45 shell left behind.\n\nIn a move that shocked everyone, the University shut its doors and sent students and faculty home. The press tore them apart for it. After all, hadn’t it become obvious by then that the killer only struck under eclipses? Sending everyone away was little more than theater. Worse, the police signed off on the decision before realizing they might have just delivered the killer back to whatever hometown he’d come from. Everyone could see it; they were desperate. Grasping at straws, as lost as the rest of us.\n\nMark, meanwhile, was transfixed, awestruck, horrified, fascinated, as if he couldn’t look away from a fire even while it consumed everything around it. I was left with something else. The same hollow aftermath that always followed: a pounding headache, sharp and sour like a hangover; a creeping numbness that dulled the edges of thought; and, beneath it all, the crushing futility of knowing it would happen again. \n\nAfter those four deaths, the town’s frenzy dulled. The headlines shrank, the nightly news moved on, and the chatter in grocery store aisles faded to silence. The case went cold, another unsolved knot consigned to rumor. The University, eager to wash its hands, erected yet another plaque, this one just off Governor’s Drive, for the three students lost. No mention of Ken Williams. A middle-aged man didn’t carry the same weight as students with futures ahead of them. His name slipped into silence, a footnote, if even that.\n\nMonths without an eclipse bled into years. Sharon started school, and life found its strange rhythm again. My career in academia began to gather momentum just as Mark’s plumbing business took off. We built a life that looked, from the outside, almost enviable. A neat house, steady work, laughter at the dinner table.\n\nMark longed for another child, a son, he said, to balance the scales. I managed to talk him out of it, sheltering behind the excuse of my career. Grants, research, conferences, I told him I needed time. But the truth was simpler and far darker. I couldn’t imagine bringing another child into a world where the air itself seemed haunted, where shadows returned every time the moon burned red. One child was enough, one was already too much to risk.\n\nNearly three whole years slipped by. We had moved into a larger, prettier house on Pine Hollow, ironically, just down the road from where Michael Strong had been butchered years before. The neighborhood near Puffer's Pond was quiet now, scrubbed clean of memory, though I could never quite forget.\n\nI buried myself in work, papers, and lectures piling one on top of another, until March crept in almost unnoticed. It was then that the familiar sensation returned, settling into me with a weight I could neither shake nor name. It began in the gut, a hollow gnawing. Not pain, exactly, but an emptiness. My skin felt restless, my blood quickened, my thoughts turned jagged. I had learned to recognize it over the years, though no explanation ever followed. It was always the same: a slow, ravenous stirring that left me uneasy in my own body, as though I had been hollowed out and replaced with something that craved more than I could ever give.\n\nWednesday, April 3rd, brought with it a flicker of hope. The eclipse that day would pass unseen, swallowed by the afternoon sky, and some whispered that perhaps this time Amherst would be spared. But hope, like every other illusion, dissolved quickly.\n\nPolice and National Guard patrolled in droves, posted on every corner, and clustered in pairs across campus, hell, across the town. Their presence was loud, visible, meant to reassure, and yet it left blind spots large enough for a body to slip right through. The killer did just that.\n\nThey walked unnoticed into the Mullins Center, where life went on as though nothing could happen under such heavy guard. Inside the women’s locker room, amid the steam and hiss of the showers, senior Chelsea McRae. The weapon was simple, domestic, no larger than a dinner knife, yet sharp enough to punch through bone. It was driven upward with such force that the blade lodged to its hilt in her jaw, pinning her scream where it started.\n\nWater continued to run, curtains drawn, steam swirling lazily through the tiled room. For several long minutes, her body went undiscovered, the scene hidden in plain sight while the killer slipped away. Only when another girl pulled back the curtain after seeing blood did the silence finally break, and the air filled with the screaming that never really leaves you once you’ve heard it.\n\nStudents and staff poured from the Mullins Center in a blind surge, bodies colliding, voices shrieking, while the authorities stumbled over themselves to cordon the exits, to push inward, to simply make sense of the chaos. In the crush of it all, the killer moved unnoticed. Their hand twitched against the grip of the concealed .45, an almost uncontrollable urge to fire into the crowd. Why didn’t they? Perhaps some primal reflex of self-preservation intervened. The instinct that usually drove them forward had, for once, held them back.\n\nInstead, they slipped toward the Physical Plant. Inside, the workers carried on, almost untouched by the commotion outside, the muffled roar of the crowd barely reaching them. One man, Devon Wade, even stopped the killer to ask what was happening. They walked past him without a word. Seconds later, inside, the killing began.\n\nRobert McMillan was the first. A single shot below the right eye, neat, clinical, and he fell without so much as a cry. The sound drew Kevin Faherty from a side door. He froze at the sight, Robert’s body sprawled on the floor, the gun already swinging toward him, and managed only a strangled “No” before the bullet buried itself in his chest.\n\nBehind the killer, another door opened. Devon Wade again, the same man who had asked so casually a moment before. Why had he come running toward gunfire? Maybe the sound was dulled, maybe the chaos outside distracted him. Whatever the reason, he lasted only a breath. A round caught his neck, sending him staggering, hands pressed to the wound as blood sprayed in great wet bursts. He collapsed, gargling on the floor.\n\nThe killer pressed on. In a supply closet, Javier Madeira was discovered curled up in a ball, whispering in accented English: “Please.” It was the only word he got out before the .45 split his skull open, painting the shelves behind him.\n\nAt the far end of the Plant, a flicker of movement gave away Raymond Gibson. He lunged before the killer could fire, a heavy fist cracking across their face. The gun discharged, the round grazing his thigh, but Gibson was built like a wall and bore down with brute strength. One massive hand clamped around the killer’s throat, the other wrenched the pistol free. For a moment, it seemed over.\n\nBut the Blood Moon Killer was not sustained by human limits. In that frenzy, they clawed downward with their free hand, nails ripping through fabric and flesh, tearing Gibson’s scrotum open in a savage, animal motion. His scream was primal, reflexive, and his grip faltered. The killer seized the .45, shoved the muzzle against his skull, and fired. Bone and brain matter spattered the wall. Gibson toppled, finally still. The Plant was silent, save for the echo of dripping water, settling dust, and the faint hiss of blood pooling on the concrete.\n\nThe killer moved on instinct alone, slipping out of the Plant with a predator’s caution, hugging the shadows, skirting the buildings where cameras were mounted. Blood clung to their skin, soaked their clothes, hardened in their hair. It should have made them visible to anyone with eyes. And in truth, people did see. Faces turned, gazes lingered, but no one intervened. In the chaos, who would step in front of a 5’3” woman dripping red when the killer was still at large?\n\nThey reached their car unchallenged, hands trembling only as the key slid into the ignition. That same nameless force that had driven the slaughter pulled them onward, down Long Plain Road, where they veered off and waded into the brook. The water was glacial, biting, yet no shock registered. Flesh numbed as the blood peeled away, drifting downstream in black-red ribbons. They stripped, tugged on stained gym clothes from a duffel bag, and weighted their ruined outfit with stones before sinking it in the current. Then back into the car, northbound, the steering wheel quivering under their grip.\n\nAbove, the Blood Moon loomed, ripe, swollen, deeper than rust. Impossible not to stare. Impossible not to feel the hunger ease, the body settling into the quiet tremor of satiation.\n\nBy the time they reached Baystate Franklin, the call had been made. A husband’s frantic voice on the other end, demanding to know what had happened. She soothed him in steady tones, explained she’d only been caught in the stampede at the Mullins Center, elbow to the eye, a forearm to the throat, the crush of bodies in flight. That, she said, was why she bore a shiner, the dark rings around her neck, the concussion pounding through her skull. The concussion justified the drive north.\n\nThe doctors weren’t convinced, not fully. Their expressions flickered with doubt, catching on the seams in her story. But she was injured, she was trembling, she was a victim. That was enough. The world bends toward the simplest explanation, and no one looked closer. And really, who could blame a woman for hysteria after escaping the Blood Moon Killer?\n\nI never really come to until the morning after. The edges of the night arrive first, fragments, impressions, and only with daylight do memory congeal into something I can hold without it slipping through my fingers. Over the years those fragments have multiplied; where there was once a black hole, there is now a series of jagged images I can piece together like a child’s brutal collage.\n\nAs a child I was described as having terrible tantrums. I remember only an echo: nine years old, a bat, my brother’s leg broken. He never forgave me. I never forgave myself once the story was told aloud and sealed into the family record. In middle school, there was a sleepover, Shelly Thomas, and I woke to a frenzy I could not name; the police were called, I was taken for observation, and released, the adults shrugging it off as a fleeting aberration. They saw me; they didn’t see what pushed me.\n\nFor a long time, I tried to contain it. I would lock myself in the house on nights when the moon threatened blood, pad the windows, and chain the doors. The ravenous thing in my gut, however, paid no attention to locks. It boiled until it burned through. If I did not feed it, if I did not give it its obscene satiation, I felt as though I would be unmade. The hunger was not metaphor. It was a pressure, a clawing pressure beneath ribs and reason, a demand that blurred thought and will until all that remained was animal survival.\n\nAfter Michael Strong, the nightmares began in earnest. I could not remember the day itself, but his scream lived inside me, a throat that would not close. Chelsea Murphy’s cry joined it, then, and the sound of bodies falling. I sought help; I sat in therapists’ rooms and tried to explain the vertigo of dread that seized me on certain nights. They assumed I was like a hundred other people in town, haunted, terrified, a sensible victim of circumstance. I let them believe it.\n\nThere were seven blank years: a strange mercy. Sharon was born; Mark and I built a life that looked ordinary. For a while, the tides of the thing within me subsided. Then Baker House happened. I could no longer pretend, no longer delude myself. The facts lined up like nails on a board. \n\nI have thought about ending it. I have imagined walking into a precinct and unspooling everything, names, dates. I have sat in the dark and pictured Mark’s face when he read the confession, Sharon’s small hands in his when the bars slammed shut. The thought recoils like a hand from a flame. Could I do that to my daughter? To the man who has loved me? Could I hand them the orphaned wreckage of a life I had already broken?\n\nAnd now I watch the calendar, this Friday drawing near, September 27th. The hunger has already started gnawing, a hollow ache that no food can touch. It coils tighter with each passing hour, a quiet reminder that resistance is futile. I don’t know what I hope for anymore. Deliverance? Discovery? Death? Perhaps all three. But I do know this: when the Blood Moon climbs the sky, its shadow swallows me whole. And when it does, the world will bleed.",

    "content": "We got here three days ago. It already feels like it’s been weeks. The drive up was long but quiet, all two-lane roads winding through mountains that looked more like walls than hills. The kind that make you feel small.\n\nMy wife, Marcy, sat beside me with the map folded across her lap. She kept pointing out trail names and creeks we’d pass, but half of them weren’t on the GPS. Our dog, Scout, slept in the back seat with his head on the cooler, and Luke followed behind us in his truck, hauling most of the gear. It was supposed to be a small vacation — four of us total, though Luke’s wife, Jamie, couldn’t make it until the next morning.\n\nWe stopped for gas near a little town at the base of the range. One of those places with a single pump and a sign that’s been sun-bleached for a decade. The man inside was old, with hands that looked like bark, and he told Luke the weather “turns strange up there.” Said forecasts don’t mean much when you’re that high. “You’ll know when it changes,” he said, “you’ll smell it first.”\n\nLuke laughed it off, but the guy didn’t. He just looked at us like he was thinking something he didn’t want to say out loud. I remember the air being colder there, even though we were still in sunlight. The wind carried this dry taste, like metal and pine.\n\nThe road after that narrowed into a path more than a highway. The higher we climbed, the less we talked. Marcy rolled the window down once to take a picture, and the cold that hit my arm felt heavier than it should have. I know that sounds stupid — cold’s just cold — but it felt like it had weight to it.\n\nWhen we reached the cabin, the sun was barely hanging over the ridge. The place looked smaller than I expected. Just two rooms and a porch, sitting in the middle of an open slope surrounded by black trees. The snowline was maybe a hundred yards uphill, but the ground was frozen solid already.\n\nLuke said his grandfather built it in the seventies. “Didn’t even have power for the first few years,” he said, knocking on one of the logs. “He just liked the quiet.” We unloaded the gear, got the generator running, and by the time the fire caught, the temperature had dropped fast enough that our breath hung thick in the cabin.\n\nThat first night felt good, though. We cooked over the fire, told stories, listened to the wood pop in the stove. It was the kind of silence you don’t get anywhere else, the kind that doesn’t feel empty. \n\nLuke said he used to come up here as a kid. “You can hear everything when it freezes,” he said. “The trees groan, the ground cracks. It sounds alive.”\nMarcy laughed and asked if that was supposed to be comforting. He grinned and said, “You’ll get used to it.”\n\nWe slept fine. Scout curled up at the foot of the bed and didn’t make a sound all night. I remember waking up once to what I thought was a branch snapping, but when I listened, I couldn’t hear anything else. Just the faint ticking of the stove cooling down.\n\nThe next morning started colder. The sky was white, but not like snow — more like a sheet of glare. The trees were wet, glistening, even though it hadn’t rained. When I stepped off the porch, the dirt cracked like glass under my boots.\n\nLuke was outside already, checking his phone. “Forecast says clear skies all week,” he said, holding it up. “Perfect timing.” Marcy laughed and said maybe we’d actually lucked out for once. None of us thought to question why the air hurt to breathe.\n\nBy midmorning, a haze had settled over the trees. You could still see through it, but the color drained from everything. Even Scout went quiet, tail low, watching the ridge. Luke said it was just a cold front moving through. He didn’t sound convinced.\n\nAround noon, the wind picked up, but only for a minute. It came hard, out of nowhere, sharp enough to make the cabin groan. Then it stopped. The silence after was heavier than before, like the air itself had frozen solid.\n\nThat’s when Luke said it. “You smell that?”\nAt first, I didn’t know what he meant. Then I caught it — that metallic edge again, stronger now, mixed with something else. Not rot exactly, but earthy and sweet. Like wet stone. He smiled, uneasy, and said, “Guess it’s changing.”\n\nWe ate lunch inside with the lantern burning even though it was still daylight. The windows had started fogging on the inside, and when I wiped one clear, the frost pattern didn’t melt. It just sat there, like a print in glass.\n\nBy afternoon, it felt colder inside than out. The fire burned high but didn’t throw much heat. Luke said he’d check the generator, but I told him to wait. Something about the light outside — flat and gray, like distance didn’t exist — made me feel sick to look at.\n\nI tried calling Jamie to see if she’d left yet, but there was no signal. Marcy tried too, same thing. We told ourselves the ridge must’ve blocked it, that she’d show up the next morning. But part of me already knew something wasn’t right.\n\nThat night, the sound started.\n\nIt started just after dark.\n\nWe’d been playing cards by the lantern because the fire wasn’t doing much. Every time the flames dropped, the air felt like it was pulling the warmth out of us. Scout lay under the table, restless, his ears twitching. When he stood up and growled at the wall, we all froze.\n\nThere was a noise outside — low, uneven, hard to place. Not the groan of trees or ice cracking. It sounded deeper, like something shifting its weight in the snow. Luke got up first, grabbed the flashlight, and opened the door before I could tell him not to.\n\nThe beam caught nothing but frost. Every branch glittered like glass, and the ground reflected light in a way that didn’t look real. I remember thinking it looked like the forest had been dipped in mercury. Scout whined and pressed himself against Marcy’s legs, tail between his.\n\nLuke stepped out onto the porch and swept the flashlight across the treeline. The beam flickered for a second, dimmed, then came back. He swore quietly and said the batteries must be dying. They were new.\n\nThe noise stopped while he was out there. Everything did. Even the small sounds you expect — wind, creaking wood — just vanished. He turned back toward us and said, “It’s fine. Probably a branch coming down.” Then, from somewhere out past the trees, something answered.\n\nIt wasn’t an echo. It was the same sound, but longer this time, dragging itself across the valley. Luke came inside fast and locked the door behind him. Nobody said a word for a long time after that.\n\nWhen we finally went to bed, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I started to drift, I heard faint cracking outside. Like something walking, stopping, walking again. Marcy whispered that it was just the ice expanding, but her voice was too tight. She didn’t believe it either.\n\nSometime around two, Scout started barking. Not the kind of bark he used for deer or raccoons. It was sharp and panicked, and he wouldn’t stop. I pulled the curtain back just a little and saw something move behind the trees.\n\nIt was tall. That’s the only thing I can say for sure. The beam from the lantern caught just enough to show a shape standing still, almost blending into the ice. Then it shifted, and I realized it wasn’t standing — it was hunched. Watching.\n\nWhen I blinked, it was gone.\n\nThe next morning, everything outside was coated in another layer of ice. The windows had to be hit with a hammer handle just to see through them. The power from the generator was weak, sputtering. \n\nLuke said he’d check the fuel line once the sun was up, but the sky never really brightened. It stayed the same flat color, like the light was coming from inside the clouds.\n\nMarcy made coffee on the stove, and the smell felt strange — too warm for the air around us. She asked if anyone else’s head hurt, said the pressure felt wrong. I told her it was just altitude, but mine hurt too.\n\nAround midmorning, Luke found tracks by the porch. At least that’s what we called them. They weren’t prints exactly — more like long impressions in the ice, almost melted into it. The shape reminded me of a hand, but stretched. The fingers, if that’s what they were, were uneven.\n\nHe said maybe a bear had slipped. I wanted to believe that, but bears don’t leave drag marks that long, and they don’t make the ground cold enough to frost over a boot print beside them.\n\nWe argued about going down the mountain to find Jamie or a signal. Luke didn’t want to leave until the weather settled. Marcy said it looked like it already had — and that maybe we’d just gotten spooked. She was trying to calm everyone down, but she couldn’t stop glancing at the windows.\n\nAt lunch, we heard something fall in the woods. A deep crash, like a tree giving way. The sound echoed for too long. Scout started whining again and paced back and forth in front of the door. When I opened it, a gust of air hit me that felt colder than anything I’ve ever felt.\n\nIt burned my skin even through my gloves. The porch steps were covered in frost that hadn’t been there ten minutes before. When I leaned down, I noticed something in the ice — small black flecks, like ash or dirt, arranged in a spiral.\n\nI scraped at it with my boot, but it didn’t come off. It was inside the ice, sealed beneath it like it had grown that way.\n\nWe stayed inside the rest of the day. Luke kept checking his watch, like he couldn’t believe how slowly the hours were passing. Marcy read aloud from an old paperback she’d brought, just to fill the silence. I didn’t hear a word of it. I kept watching the frost crawl higher up the windows.\n\nBy evening, we knew Jamie wasn’t coming. There hadn’t been any sign of her all day — no headlights, no noise from the road. The ice was thick enough now that we couldn’t open the back door. The air inside had this faint smell of metal, almost like blood.\n\nScout wouldn’t eat. He sat by the window and stared at the same patch of trees. Once, just before dark, I thought I saw something move there again. Only this time, it didn’t disappear right away.\nIt swayed slightly, side to side, like it was breathing. Then the sky dimmed, and it was gone.\n\nThat night the wind came back, but it didn’t sound like wind. It whistled low through the cracks in the boards, pulsing in short breaths. Scout barked once and then crawled under the table, trembling hard enough that I could hear his collar rattle.\n\nLuke kept saying it was just the storm. He tried to start the generator again, but the engine only coughed. Every time he stepped toward the door, the sound outside stopped — like whatever was out there was waiting for him to move first.\n\nMarcy lit another lantern. The flame bent toward the window even though the air was still. I told her to turn it off, but she said she couldn’t stand the dark. We sat together on the couch, boots still on, bags packed in case the roof came down.\n\nSometime after midnight, the wall near the stove popped. Not from heat, but from cold — a hard crack that made the whole room shake. Luke swore and ran to check the pipes. When he opened the back door, a blast of air hit us that felt like needles.\n\nHe froze in the doorway. I asked what he saw, but he didn’t answer right away. Then he said, “There’s something standing in the snow.”\n\nI thought he was joking until I saw his face. I walked over, pulled the door wider, and looked past him.\nIt was standing maybe thirty yards away, near the first line of trees. At first I thought it was a man. It was shaped like one — two legs, long arms, head tilted slightly — but it was too tall. Eight feet at least, maybe ten. The limbs were so thin they looked like they’d snap if it moved too fast.\n\nThe knees bent the wrong way, jointed backward like a bird’s. Its arms hung down past its knees, fingers sharp and narrow. I could see ribs pressing through its chest, skin stretched tight like wet paper. The surface of it shimmered — not hair, not scales, just a sheen like thin ice.\n\nThen it lifted its head. Two yellow eyes caught the lantern light and reflected it back. They didn’t blink. Behind its shoulders, something shifted. For a second I thought they were shadows, but they moved — slow and deliberate — like wings folding against its back.\n\nLuke whispered, “What the hell is that?” but none of us had an answer.\n\nThe thing crouched, almost folding in half. I heard the snow compress under its weight. The wind blew harder, and sheets of it blurred everything beyond the porch. I could still see the glow of its eyes, bright and steady through the white.\n\nIt stayed there, hunched low, until the storm began to swallow the clearing. The more the snow came down, the less of it we could see — just those eyes, floating in the dark like lanterns. Then it began to move.\n\nIt didn’t walk away at first. It stood, straightening in one slow, unnatural motion until its head brushed the lowest branches of the pines. The wings unfurled just a little, heavy with ice. And then it turned — its body shifting toward the trees, but its head didn’t move. It stayed locked on us the whole time.\n\nEven as the snow covered it, I could feel it watching. Like something behind glass. Then it was gone. Just a black shape dissolving into the white.\nLuke shut the door and dropped the bar across it. None of us spoke. Scout whined once and then curled up so tight his nose disappeared under his tail.\n\nWe waited another hour before we moved. The wind screamed so loud it shook the lantern on its hook. Marcy sat by the stove with her hands pressed to her face. I tried to warm my fingers, but the tips had already gone numb. They stayed pale long after the fire came back.\n\nI told myself it was just frostbite. That what we saw was some animal caught in the storm, and the cold had made our eyes play tricks. But even now, when I blink, I can still see those yellow lights in the dark.\nWe tried to sleep, but every sound outside made us jolt awake. The creak of a branch, the slam of loose shutters — all of it sounded like footsteps.\n\nBy morning, the world was buried. The thermometer on the porch was frozen solid. The storm hadn’t been in any forecast we checked.\n\nLuke wanted to hike out right then, but the trees were bent under ice, the path gone. Marcy begged him to wait until it cleared. He said fine, one more night, and then we’re leaving.\n\nThat was yesterday.\n\nThe ice hasn’t melted. If anything, it’s thicker. \n\nWe’re running out of food and the snow on the roof is getting heavier and heavier. I need to fix both problems but it’s still out there, I can feel it. I don’t know what to do. Can someone please help?",

    "content": "I work night shifts in a near-remote five-star resort. I have worked here for over two years and had recently transferred to the night shift because it paid better. For the past few days, strange things have been happening. Before I start my account on what’s happened over the past four days I’d like to mention that the names of places and people in this post have been changed for privacy reasons. I am in an Asian country (not one of the glamorous ones) but I am not a native. The names you see here have been anglicised. \n\n\n\n05 November 2025\n\n\n\n At around two in the morning, the music in the lobby had turned off for some reason. Ethan went to check, but couldn’t turn it back on. We’d already finished most of the jobs for the night, so I decided to take a drive around the property in the golf cart. The resort was less than half full, so a couple of the buildings had no guests in them. \n\n\n\nAs I drove past Building 2, which was closed because of the low occupancy, I saw a light on the 5th floor. I decided to check, as I had the master key with me. I got to the fifth floor and checked the room in which I had seen the light in, 2508. The room was empty and dark, and didn’t have a key card inserted into the socket inside, and hence, no electricity. I chalked it up to one of the late night technicians checking something, and went back to my drive.\n\n\n\n On my way back, I passed building 2 again, and the light was still on. I went to check again, and same thing. This time though, I opened the door and went inside.  I slid a keycard into the socket and the lights clicked back on. I inspected the room for anything out of the ordinary. Nothing. I took the keycard out. The light stayed on, it took a few seconds for it to turn off. Right before the light flicked off, I saw a figure in the balcony of the room, looking outwards. Confused, I put the key card back in the socket and went to the balcony. Nothing.  I finished up there and went back to the reception. On the way back, the golf cart felt heavier, as if someone was sitting in the back seat. I didn’t mind it as much then.\n\n\n\nWhen I was back the music was back on. I asked Ethan how he managed to fix the speakers, and he shot me a look of confusion. I admit, there’s a language barrier here. Ethan’s English is no better than my command over the local language, so I didn’t think too much of it. \n\n\n\nNothing happened for the rest of the night, I finished up my shift at 08:00 and went to bed at around 08:30.\n\n\n\n06 November 2025\n\n\n\nIt was another slow day. I was done with my reports around half past two. I was browsing YouTube shorts on my phone, trying to keep boredom at bay. Usually, I’d listen to horror podcasts or creepypastas during this time, but I didn’t feel like it that day. \n\n\n\nAs I was scrolling through, I heard footsteps approaching me from the right side. I turned my head to see nothing. I went back to my phone, but the footsteps started again. This continued in a loop for a few minutes. At first, I thought it was Ethan, going in and out from the back office. But Ethan was sitting in one of the couches out front, scrolling on his phone. I decided to investigate. The path on the right led to the retail shop inside the hotel, and after that it extended to Building 2. I checked the shop , and found nothing. I thought of going to Building 2 to check what was happening, but then the phone rang. I walked over back to the front desk, but the ring had cut by the time I reached. I checked the history to see where it was from, and it said Room number 2508. I looked over at Ethan, who was still on his phone. He didn’t seem to have heard the ring. I tried calling back to the room but got no response. A few minutes later, the phone rang again. It was the same room. I picked it up.\n\n\n\n“Good Morning, you’re connected to the front desk, How may I assist you?” the words came out by habit. \n\n\n\n\n\n“Oh.. Hey.. Good Morning.. Can we get a couple of water bottles to the room?” It was a woman’s voice. “We’re in the room – Honey what room are we in? – uh  2508.”\n\n\n\n“Of course ma’am. We’ll send them right away.” I hung up the call. I checked the systems to see if there were any guests in 2508. There weren’t. I checked the call history again to check the room number, to see if I had misread it, but I had not. Still confused, I asked Ethan to man the counter while I delivered the water bottles to the room.  \n\n\n\nOnce I reached building 2, I could see the lights on the fifth floor. I climbed up and rang the doorbell to 2508. A woman opened the door. \n\n\n\n“Thank you very much. I’m sorry to be a bother.” She said, it took me a second but I recognised her. She had stayed in the same room two or three weeks ago. She had made a similar call then as well. She must have really liked the room. \n\n\n\nAfter I got back to the front desk I checked the systems once again with her name, which I had fished up from last month’s reports. Strangely enough I found nothing. I made a note for the day shift to follow it up, and went on with my night. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07 November 2025\n\n\n\nWhen I came to work for the day, Dani told me that she found no guests in 2508. She worked the afternoon shift that day, and had checked the room herself. It was busy that day, I couldn’t get a breather until five in the morning, and even then, guests started to come check out one by one. At around 05:40, I got a call from 2508 to collect their luggage. I went to the room and rang the doorbell multiple times, only for no one to open the door. I opened the room with my master key card and there was no one there.\n\n\n\n I started for the elevator but suddenly I heard sounds of footsteps and luggage rolling behind me. I turned around , and for a split second, I swear I could see myself, rolling three suitcases towards the elevator. I stood there, staring until the ding of the elevator brought me back to my senses. I quickly went down to the golf cart and drove to the lobby. The golf cart was heavy, similar to what had happened a couple of days ago, but it felt much heavier this time. When I reached the front desk, Ethan asked me what was wrong. Apparently I had been sweating like crazy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing strange happened for the next couple of days, which brings us to today. Today was probably the weirdest of them all, which is why I decided to write this. \n\n\n\n08 November 2025\n\n\n\nIt was another slow day. After finishing work,  I defaulted back to my favorite pastime, driving the golf cart around. I paid close attention to building two, but everything seemed normal. We actually had guests occupying several rooms in the building now, but not on the fifth floor. As I was driving through, Ethan called me and told me that a guest had requested a golf cart to building 8. Building 8 was at the other side of the hotel, but I didn’t mind a good drive. When I reached the building, the guests were already at the ground floor waiting for me. They were a sweet old couple, who I had helped check on the previous day.  I parked and helped them get comfortably seated. Then I reversed the car to get back on the path, but I heard a loud thud. \n\n\n\nI turned around to check, and the old couple had disappeared. I got out of the cart to check, and realised it was raining heavily. How did I not notice that? Like I couldn’t remember when the rain started, it was just there. I made my way over to the back of the golf cart to see what I’d hit, only to find a child, about four years of age, fallen down and passed out.\n\n\n\nTo say I panicked is an understatement. I tried to get myself under control and picked the child up. The rain in my eyes didn’t help at all.  He was completely passed out, and I didn’t see anyone else nearby. I laid him down on the front seat of the golf cart. Now completely drenched, I started the golf cart back up. As my foot pressed down on the accelerator, I heard the rain stop, as abrupt as it started.\n\n\n\n“Is everything alright Mark?” I heard a familiar voice from the back. I turned to see the old couple I picked up. I looked to my left and where there was the boy, there was now no sign of him. It took me a moment to realise that me, and the surroundings were now completely dry. \n\n\n\n“Y-yea I uh.. I thought I hit something.” I said and drove to the front desk. The rest of the night was uneventful. \n\n\n\nI woke up around four in the evening to a call from my girlfriend. She had gotten a job in the same area, and was coming over in a week.  I am excited about that. Anyways, I also saw a notification in the employee group chat about an accident. Apparently one of the bellmen hit a young boy while reversing the golf cart at building three. I clicked on the image to get a better look.\n\n\n\nIt was the same boy I saw last night.\n\n\n\nThat’s all for now. I have to eat something and get ready for my shift today. It has been a weird couple of days at work, so I thought I’d share it somewhere. It’s pouring right now, which is a pain in the ass for me. I’m out of water, I’ve to go buy some more. Anyways, if you know what the hell is going on in my resort, please let me know. I hope I don’t have to write another one of these.",

    "content": "After everything else that had happened today, I didn't think that my heart could sink lower in my chest, but as I slowly made my way across the street, I felt my heart sink passed my stomach to my toes, each step my body took forward, a crushing blow to my already tortured ticker. \n\nAs I stood outside, I heard the familiar voices of my best friends; Joey who owned the bar was cracking jokes, as always, Mike and Larry were laughing their asses off, while Brent and his gf brandy argued loudly. I could hear all of this, the sounds of my closest friends simply living their lives, as I begged my body to turn around, to leave and go anywhere else. I was confused as instead of walking into the bar as I feared it would, or walking away as I hoped it would, my body just stood and listened. \n\nThe arguing got louder for a moment before I heard what i could only imagine to be a snarky joke from joey followed by the chorus of Brent, mike, and Larry’s laughter followed by footsteps quickly headed toward me. My body slipped to the side behind the door as it swung open, a voice I recognized as brandy’s yelled “fuck you guys I'm going home.”\n\n She sounded upset, I thought to myself. I wondered what they did to upset her this time, before I heard joey say presumably to brent, “aren't you going to get her? to which Brent replied “nah she does this all the ti-” his sentence was cut short by the door closing shut.\n\nI thought my heart was going to crawl back up my body like a rope ladder and fall out of my mouth, as Brandy walked toward the curb and pulled out her cigarettes, staring off into the street, painfully unaware that my body was pinned directly behind her, silently following like a shadow.\n\n I wanted to scream out; to warn her in any way but I couldn't muster as much as a whisper. She put a cigarette to her lips, and patted her pocket, “Oh shit I forgot my lighter she said, before she turned around. When she turned around, she jolted backwards, likely frightened at my silent presence before saying “oh shit peter! you scared me!”. \n\nI stood still for a moment before my arms shot out in front of me, my hands instantly found their position on her throat. As my body choked the life out of her, I thought about how much I had always enjoyed her presence in our little gang, even if she fought with Brent too often. \n\nThe eye contact as I choked her was brutal for me emotionally, but I felt like I had to at least try to tell her with my eyes that I was sorry, a message I doubt she understood or received as her eyes became still and her heart stopped beating. I was thinking about the fleeting nature of connection and how meaningful of a member of my group brandy had been, as my body tossed her corpse into the street.\n\nI wanted this to end so badly, but my body relentless in its mission, dragged my shattered soul silently kicking and screaming into my best friend's bar. As I walked in, I couldn't help but feel disgust for my friends, they were still laughing about brandy.\n\nAs Joey saw me, he perked up and shouted “PETER!!!!” before he said, “Brandy out there throwing a fit still? or is she ready to come sit at the adult's table?”. I was disgusted, they were making fun of her, as she lay dead in the parking lot. “Some people have no respect” I thought to myself. \n\nI doubted they would have been laughing if they knew what I had just done to her. especially Brent. Despite the slight irritation I felt towards my friends in the moment, there is no way that I could ever reasonably say they deserved what happened to them next.\n\nI silently walked past my friends into the bathroom, as i made my way passed them, Joey said “Peter! what's wrong buddy? No Hello, how's it going, fuck you, or nothing?’, but I didn't reply as I walked past and based off the state of the bar, I noticed that they were already all likely very intoxicated. \n\nBefore I stepped into the bathroom, my body did something that confused me, I stopped right outside the bathroom door, looked to my left and turned on the jukebox, the most recently played track highway to hell started playing and as I walked into the bathroom, I slid the volume tuner all the way up.\n\nThe music was so loud that the mirror in the bathroom vibrated as I looked at myself in it for a moment, before my body turned to face me toward the door. I thought I was going to do something in there, but I didn't, I was seemingly just lying in wait for the first of my friends to stumble into the bathroom. \n\nI was afraid for them, as I had seen firsthand what my body was capable of. As I wondered which of my friends would be the first to walk in, I couldn't really think of any order that I would have been happy with, I love all of my friends.\n\nI could have spent forever in that moment if I were allowed to, standing alone with good music on had been the best part of my awful day so far, even if I was standing in a smelly men's bathroom, at least for the moment I wasn't hurting anyone. My brief reprieve was unfortunately interrupted by the door opening as Brent sluggishly stepped in and the door closed behind him. \n\nHe made his way past me to the last of the 3 sinks deepest in the bathroom before he started splashing himself with water. He looked like he was about to throw up when he said, “I feel like shit peter.” Before I walked over to him and slammed his head against the mirror.\n\nHe immediately started to bleed from his head, but he wasn't done, he punched me in the face, as I heard the song switch, now playing let the bodies hit the floor. As weird as it sounds, I was proud of Brent for trying to fight back, I just wish he could have won it would have been far better than what happened.\n\nI had no physical reaction to the punch as I grabbed him and threw him into the stall on the end. He started kicking which in my mind was a good idea, but it didn't work. My hand caught his foot and dragged him off the toilet, he fought me so hard that he had turned himself completely around, at this point my body decided to do the unthinkable, I stood up over him before quickly bending over and forcing his face into the toilet. \n\nHe was thrashing hard, and to be fair I would have to. “Not the toilet! I'm sorry buddy!” I thought as I felt his thrashing slow to a stop. I was horrified at what I had just done, I couldn't imagine doing that to my worst enemy, let alone one of my closest friends. \n\nI silently wished for a self-destruct button, the pain I was causing didn't make sense to me, every cell in my body was screaming in protest as I calmly walked out the bathroom and as I walked by the jukebox, I turned it off. \n\nMy body dragged me toward the bar and as I approached my friends, I could tell that they were severely impaired. I wanted to warn them, to stop, to do anything to prevent what was coming, but I've never been a very lucky person. As I got closer to the bar, I saw mike lean back too far in his chair before rocketing backwards to the floor. \n\nHe was so inebriated that he didn't even get back up. my body continued its march forward until I was standing over mikes body. I stared down at him for a moment when i heard Larry say “what are you doin Pete? Aren't you gonna help him up?” I looked up at Larry with no emotion on my face despite the hell I felt inside as I lifted my foot before slamming it through mikes head. \n\nThe deep squeeze and sickening pop reminded me of the time I accidentally crushed the watermelon my mother was growing. The moment I did it. my best friend Joey drew his firearm on me, and Larry stood up off his stool in a panic screaming “Peter what the FUCK DID YOU DO!!”\n\nMy body stood still as Joey through wet eyes said “P- put your g- goddamn hands up peter! If you move, I will shoot you. Do you fucking understand me, man?” My body nodded before I jolted towards joey, as his finger moved to the trigger I dragged Larry in front of me, like a human shield.\n\nDespite Larry’s resistance, all he could do was move exactly where my body needed him, and all I could scream in my mind was the word “No”, as I watched joey squeeze the trigger and felt Larry violently shift in my arms one final time.\n\n“NOOOOOO!!!, Larry!!!!” Joey screamed in a profound yet painful way. A feeling I could fully relate too, a scream I had been mirroring on the inside all day. I stared into his eyes, trying to explain with them, but I could tell that he didn't see polite peter his best friend, he saw a killer, there was nothing but contempt in his eyes.\n\nTears ran down his face as he said, “You Mother fucker!” Before he pulled the trigger, and the gun clicked. Hearing this my body immediately reached for him pulling him over the bar, before I sat on his stomach and punched him repeatedly until his face no longer resembled a face at all.\n\nI stared at the destroyed face that used to be my best friend when I felt my blinking change. It was an automated process, I had no choice in that I had gotten used to, I wasn't even thinking about it at first. I was staring at him unblinking, when I wished I could close my eyes, and keep them shut, and to my surprise the next time my eyes closed they didn't automatically reopen, they stayed closed.\n\nI stayed that way for a moment, appreciating the seemingly small but really huge to me autonomy to choose to keep them closed. I might have stayed locked in that moment forever, if my nose hadn't itched. When my hand automatically moved to scratch my nose, it felt different, less tactile, less smooth than my motion had been ever since I woke up in the hospital. My movement felt more or less the way it felt before the accident. \n\nI opened my eyes, and they followed my command. I was staring at my hands, studying them, seemingly normal hands, and painfully my own, and wondering if I could ever forgive them.\n\nIn this moment, I couldn't help but collapse into a heap of emotion on the floor as I allowed my body to feel all of the torment that has ravaged my mind. In the silence of the bar now littered with my dead friends.\n\nFrom this unenviable position, I heard the tv in the corner play a patriotic tune before I heard our current president begin to speak “My fellow Americans! I’m calling this presidential address today to inform the public of a successful anti-terrorist mission that successfully cleared the terrorists out of the nation of taured. This mission was completed by an elite task force of highly trained and decorated soldiers, who thanks to the brilliant minds over at the Merriweather institute have been outfitted with the latest and greatest innovation of modern war, AI battle enhancement pathways that connect directly to the soldiers brain, allowing them to make the most brutally efficient decisions that an average human would mess up 20 percent of the time, with a 100 percent success rate. This new technology will change the way wars are fought, but as of right now there is only one group on the planet who has it and so far, I haven't seen a single downside.”\n\nI felt his words wash over me, with a cold dread, as they recontextualized everything I had been through today. I cried up at the tv “WHAT ABOUT ME!?” but I knew I wasn't ever getting an answer. I wondered if the people of Taured that had been killed were anything like the people I had murdered. Doctors, Bakers, Video store owners, and Friends.\n\n( Looking for what happened before this?

    "content": "If there is a job that no one actually wants to do, it's call center work. I firmly believe any claims of there being contract call center companies that are on the level and not hell to work at are manufactured to trick people into applying.\n\n​\n\nWhat you take calls for may vary, but the experience is the same, you start each day hoping that it won't be back-to-back calls, and end the day kicking yourself for hoping working conditions would be fair this time.\n\n​\n\nEventually, the client catches on to the company half-assing their work, and they get dropped.\n\n​\n\nThat leads to scrambling for a new client who if they’re working with us, that’s an indicator of shadiness right off the back.\n\n​\n\nIn my case, the trouble began when our client UltraSAT, was acquired by another company called “IFTV”.\n\n​\n\nNone of us could find much about the company, but everyone was worried about what could come from this.\n\n​\n\nPay cuts were expected, along with possible relocation, or INFTV deciding they didn’t want to pay the lease on the building and make us work from home. We did find out that they would be making changes to programming available, so that meant tons of calls where people would be asking “where did these channels go?”.\n\n​\n\nThe changes were said to go into effect that Friday, at the end of our work week.\n\n​\n\nThat Friday, I sat down at my cubicle and readied in.\n\n​\n\nWithin half a second, I was on a call, it was a pretty basic one, an older sounding customer asking why his screen was stretched.\n\n​\n\nI started out asking probing questions, then explained that older TV shows are in a different aspect ratio, and his receiver was trying to correct the resolution to make it fit.\n\n​\n\nIt sounds simple, but for our customer base, I might as well be explaining quantum physics in another language.\n\n​\n\nLittle did I know my first call of the day would be one of the last normal calls I’d get for the rest of my shift.\n\n​\n\nThe next call came in, I’m going to try my best to recall it and the other ones I received that night from memory.\n\n​\n\n“Thank you for calling UltraSAT. How may I help you today?”\n\n​\n\nAll I heard at first was the sound of someone sobbing, then he spoke.\n\n​\n\n“I… I can’t see my TV.”\n\n​\n\nI checked my knowledge base and got ready to play twenty questions to get to the problem.\n\n​\n\n“Alright, have you checked to make sure the TV is plugged in and turned on?”\n\n​\n\n“I can’t… I can't see anything.”\n\n​\n\nVisually impaired customers weren’t a rare scenario, so I had to pull up what we did to troubleshoot with them.\n\n​\n\n“Okay, sir, is there anyone who can help you?”\n\n​\n\nHe started to sob again.\n\n​\n\n“No, they’re gone… he took them from me.”\n\n​\n\n“He?”\n\n​\n\nHe started to sound frustrated.\n\n​\n\n“The TV man you sent over, he said he was here to update our cable box, but instead he took my family away!”\n\n​\n\n“Sir, please calm dow-“\n\n​\n\nHe cut me off with angry shouting.\n\n​\n\n“The bastard knocked me to the floor while another one ran at my wife, and he dug his thumbs into my eyes!”\n\n​\n\nThat last part caught my attention.\n\n​\n\n“I’m sorry, did you just say one of our technicians stuck his thumbs in your eyes?”\n\n​\n\n“YES! While he held me down, I heard the other one dragging my wife away! I don’t even know how long it’s been. I had to feel around for just the shape of my phone, and when I asked Siri to call 911, it just kept calling your fucking company!”\n\n​\n\nHe was just yelling. I would have rerouted him to emergency services, but we can only transfer to other departments.\n\n​\n\n“Help me! There has to be someone you can put me through that can at least get an ambulance out here!”\n\n​\n\nI finally went to Slack and asked for help. I saw that I wasn’t the only one getting customers screaming for help, every single one was responded to with “transfer to supervisor line.”\n\n​\n\nI hated that, because normally all that happens is , they just go to another department because we don’t have a supervisor line, which means they eventually call back even angrier than before, but I was starting to get messages to get off the phone, so I told the customer I said that I would get him to a supervisor and transferred the call.\n\n​\n\nThis became a call type I would get, and that was how they would end most of the time.\n\n​\n\nThe second type of call I got would be people complaining about the new channels and programming, which included:\n\n​\n\nThe pain channel, whose programming consisted of shows about people being severely injured with names like “That should have killed ‘em”, “extreme animal mauling's”, and “Who wants to be a pile of red goo?”.\n\n​\n\nThe Monster Network, these shows all revolved around monsters ripping people apart.\n\n​\n\nAnd one that most would just describe as “the staring channel”.\n\n​\n\nThese were also resolved by transferring to a “supervisor”.\n\nThe last type of call, I dreaded getting again.\n\n​\n\nIt would go like this:\n\n​\n\n“Thank you for calling UltraSAT-“\n\n​\n\n“Please! Send a technician, something is wrong with our TV!”\n\n​\n\n“Okay, calm down, ma’am. What’s wrong with your TV?”\n\n​\n\n“It’s trying to eat me!”\n\n​\n\n“What?”\n\n​\n\n“It’s trying to EAT ME!”\n\n​\n\nThat’s when I heard the sound of banging on a door.\n\n​\n\n“You’ve got to send someone! Please! It’s about to-“\n\n​\n\nHer pleas were interrupted by the door being broken down, the remainder of the call consisted of the customer screaming. Per our rules, I had to hang up after she failed to respond after I reached out to her three times.\n\n​\n\n10 hours of these calls, with my only reprieve being 2 15-minute breaks, lunch, and one final 10 minute break.\n\n​\n\nWe weren't allowed to use our phones in the breakroom, so I just walked in, bought a snack, and walked out. I didn't notice at the time that more and more of my coworkers were just sitting there at the tables.\n\n​\n\nIt was near the end of my shift, so to spare myself from going into overtime with these calls, I did an old trick:\n\nI made sure that as soon as the call was over, it went to break.\n\n​\n\nFrom there, it was just a matter of luck, I was hoping the next call would not end before 11:50.\n\n​\n\nI got very lucky, it was one of the now rare basic troubleshooting calls, a welcome change from what I had been experiencing all night. After helping the customer with his TV input problems, the call ended, and I went right to break.\n\n​\n\nIt was when I arrived at the break room for the last time that I noticed something was wrong with my coworkers. They were all just standing in a circle in the middle of the room, most of them I remember seeing on my prior breaks and lunch, they clocked out hours ago, they shouldn't still be here. I walked over to them, a little confused.\n\n​\n\nThat's when I noticed the smell, well smells, tandem odors competing to see which one would make me gag first, what I can now identify as Sulfur, and Flesh.\n\n​\n\n“Um, hey, what's going on? Is there a meeting or something?”\n\n​\n\nMy question hung in the air, it was like they didn't even know I was there.\n\n​\n\n“Hello? “\n\n​\n\nI got in front of one of my coworkers, and immediately recoiled… his eyes were missing, I turned to see that everyone on the other side of the circle were missing their eyes as well.\n\n​\n\nI looked down and saw in the center a pile of human eyes.\n\n​\n\n“What the fuck?!” I remember shouting and backing away from the circle\n\n​\n\n“What is wrong with all of you?!\n\n​\n\nNobody answered, instead, they all started holding hands and whispering.\n\n​\n\nI backed up to the door, and I saw the time on the clock, it was midnight.\n\n​\n\nIt starts becoming a blur from here. I remember the temperature getting higher, and an orange light coming from inside the circle of coworkers.\n\n​\n\nAnd what looked like the silhouette of a person rising up from the floor, then clear as day, it spoke:\n\n​\n\n“Hello former UltraSAT employees, and welcome to the start of your new career as an employee of Inferno TV! Now hold on tight, as you will have to relocate.”\n\n​\n\nIt was when the ground began shaking violently, I finally felt like I was able to leave the break room and ran out the exit door to my car, I sped out of the parking lot, in my rearview mirror I saw my now former place of work continuing to shake, before what i could only describe as large red fingers emerging from the ground.\n\n​\n\nThey wrapped around the building and began to pull it down. The last thing I remember was driving home, locking all of my doors, and sitting in the corner of my bedroom holding a bible to my chest.\n\n​\n\nI woke up the next morning and felt compelled to go back to work, or at least the building.\n\nWhat I found was the aftermath of A giant demonic hand pulling a building into the ground, looks like I'm unemployed.\n\n​\n\nIn between job hunting, I found an article that had been written about UltraSAT, that my building had been built on top of limestone caves and that a sinkhole had formed and caused the collapse, and no bodies could be exhumed at this moment.\n\nLooking at the national news confirmed it was not confined to just my building.\n\nI did get my last paycheck, though, well, I got a stack of  money  with slightly burned edges on my coffee table with a note that read.\n\n“We’re sad to see you go, but if you're ever in the neighborhood, you're always welcome back and we will be waiting for you. Inferno-TV, formerly UltraSAT.”",

    "content": "My beautiful wife, *She Who Remains Upon the Earth*, finally left me alone again.  It’s been about an hour and I don’t know when she’ll be back.  If you’re reading this, please let me know you’re real.  I can’t talk to anyone I know with her around, not my old friends, not the police, not even our parents.  She won’t let me, at least not in any way that matters.  I just need someone to know what happened to us and talk to someone without feeling her behind them.\n\nI don’t even know where she is right now, just that she’s out doing something in town and could be back at any time.  Usually, this leaves me a few hours to breathe and finally move my body like it’s my own again.  I could go workout in the sun room.  The snare heads on my drumseat in the basement probably have dust I could clean off.  The hot tub on the back deck has a great view of the valley.  I know she’d love to join me if she finds me there when she gets home.\n\nI still can’t leave though.  The doors are all unlocked, but I can’t make my hand turn the knob.  Once, I even tried breaking the front door down with an axe.  Got one good hit in on the mahogany just for my body to freeze up mid-swing.  She wasn't happy about that one.  Even when she’s gone, she won’t let me go.\n\nI need to breathe.  She won’t let me leave, but I wanted to see if I can type.  My fingers seem to be moving fine so far, so that’s a good sign.  It’s so peaceful for now.  You won’t be able to save me anyway, so there’s no need to rush.  I can't open the door, so she probably already knows I’m doing this.  She won’t kill me though.  When she gets back, I’ll just apologize and wait until she’s gone again, not that she's ever been gone since we met.\n\nIt’s been almost twenty years since I first met the twins.  Looking back on it now, I think that was the earliest clear memory I have of my childhood.  Makes sense.  Everything always leads back to them.\n\nIt was an early summer morning, right after my elementary school let out for the break.  My friend Caleb, the only other kid my age in our neighborhood, was already away with his family on vacation, leaving me to play on my own.  I didn’t mind though.  I was already hard at work building dirt fortresses for my dinosaur toys in the backyard, the muddy rut by our tree filled with hose water for the armies to fight each other in.\n\n“Nathan,” my mother called from the back porch.  “Having fun?”\n\n“Yeah, Mom.  Just making a river.”\n\n“Just try not to get muddy,” she said, knowing full well it was going to happen.  “The new neighbors should be here in a bit.  Dad and I are gonna see if they need any help, so stay in the yard where we can see you.”\n\n“Okay, Mom.”\n\nShe went back inside and I looked through the short chainlink fence into the next yard over.  The grass had gotten overgrown in the summer weather, making it look like the woods out back were creeping up to the deck.  The old couple who used to live there had left I don’t know how long before, leaving the house on the corner of our block dark and empty.\n\nI was so wrapped up in my own little game I almost didn’t notice the sound of the moving trucks pulling in next door.  The voices of several people, including my Mom and Dad, started chatting near the front.  Metal doors opened and shut for a while, mixed with sounds of men saying “Careful with that” and a woman shouting “Delila, wait for your sister!”\n\nBarely a few seconds later, the back door to the house burst open.  Out ran a young girl about my age, dressed in grass-stained shoes and overalls.  Her fiery red hair was partly pulled back into a messy ponytail like she wouldn’t sit still long enough to finish it.  I was probably right because she jumped all the way down the steps and took off sprinting through the yard, arms out like an airplane and laughing with the widest grin I’d ever seen.  She leapt and spun and looked to the woods out back like she couldn’t wait to explore every inch of them.\n\nThen, she looked at me.\n\n“Hey!”\n\nShe dashed over to the fence, rattling the metal when she bounced onto it.  I was shocked, both by her energy and how fast she made it across the yard.  Both her smile and stormy grey eyes were wide and shining when she looked at me.\n\n“You have dinosaurs?!” she shouted.  “That’s awesome!  Do you wanna play with me?”\n\n“I-”\n\n“Lila.”\n\nA different, softer voice called out across the yard.  Another girl stepped out of the backdoor, this one in a blue dress with a head of wavy, raven hair.\n\n“Mom said not to-” She stopped when she noticed me.  Her eyes, the same grey as the girl at the fence, met mine and she started to walk over to us.\n\n“Come on!” said the redhead, turning her back to me.  “I just wanted to see everything.  Look!  We have a new neighbor, and he’s got toys!”\n\nThe other girl slowly walked across the yard to the fence line, holding her hands behind her back and stepping with more grace than a kid our age should have had.  I thought she looked like a princess.  She made it over to us and looked at me with curiosity.  Her face and eyes were the same as the first girl's, but she didn’t have the same wild energy.  Her expression was focused and calculating, her eyes studying me.\n\n“I’m Lila!” the first one said, pointing a thumb at herself.  “This is my sister, Nora.”\n\n“Hello,” she said softly.  “It’s nice to meet you.”\n\n“... hi,” I finally spat out.  “Mom and Dad said the new neighbors would be here today.  My name’s Nathaniel.”\n\nLila laughed.  “That’s not a kid’s name.  I’m gonna call you Nate!”\n\n“Don’t be rude, Delila,” Nora said, scowling a bit while her sister stuck her tongue out.  She looked back at me with a small smile.  “I think Nathaniel is a great name.”\n\n“Thanks, but it’s okay.  Most people call me Nate or Nathan anyway.  Whatever you want to say is good.”\n\n“Nathan.”  As if to prove my point, my Mom called to me from the neighbors back porch.  Next to her stood a woman with black hair like Nora’s.  She was young, probably younger than my parents, but just the look in her eyes betrayed how tired she was.\n\n“Girls,” she said, sounding exhausted.  “I told you not to run off.”\n\n“Sorry, Mom,” said Nora calmly.  “Lila ran outside without asking again.”\n\n“No I didn't!\" Lila shot back defiantly.  “I asked if we could look around!”\n\n“That doesn’t mean you get to run off.  What if you got hurt or broke something?”\n\n“I was just having fun!  Isn’t that right, Nate?”\n\n“Uh…” I wasn’t sure how to respond, or how I got into the middle of the sister’s bickering.  The two kept at it, the annoyance in Nora’s voice making it through her mature tone, while Lila made it very clear she thought she had done nothing wrong.\n\nTheir mom ran both hands through her unkempt hair, mouthing something to Mom that looked like an apology.  Her face was trembling like she was about to cry.  Mom smiled at her and said something I’m sure was reassuring, but it didn’t seem to help much.  The girls just kept arguing, so I decided to try something.\n\n“Do you both wanna come over?”\n\nThe twins finally stopped to look at me.  Their mom raised her head and wiped her misty eyes, surprised but thankful for the silence.\n\n“I just made a river for my dinosaurs, and I’ve got a swing in my tree you can use.  We can play other stuff too if you want.”\n\n“Yes!” Lila shouted excitedly, clasping her hands together.  “Can I be the Spinosaurus?  Please?”\n\n“You cried while watching that movie,” Nora said with a sigh.\n\n“I’ll let you,” I said, making her wild smile even bigger, “but you should ask your mom first.”\n\nLila turned back and ran to the porch while Nora whispered *Thank you*, barely audible yet crystal clear, like she was talking right into my ear.\n\n“Please can we play with Nate, Mom?  I’m sorry I ran.”\n\n“That’s okay, sweetheart,” she said with a sniffle.  “I know you were just excited.  And I don’t want to impose…”\n\n“Not at all, Ellen,” Mom chimed in.  “Nathan’s been cooped up since school let out.  It’ll be good for the kids to let out some energy.  Now, let’s get some more of your stuff put away.  They’ll be safe in the yard.”\n\n“Thank you, but I’m not sure if-”\n\n“Mom,” Nora said gently.  Her grey eyes stared directly at her mother.  “Please.”\n\nIt took her just one second too long to respond.  “Okay, girls.  Just be careful.”\n\n“Stay in the yard,” my Mom added, “and don’t climb the big tree.  I’ll come check on you guys in a bit.”\n\n“We’ll be careful!” Lila said, her eyes beaming.  She gave her mom a tight hug before they went back inside.  Our moms had barely shut the backdoor when she dashed and vaulted just over the top of the fence, landing right in front of me.\n\n“Wow!” I said, stunned.\n\n“Thanks!” she replied before laughing loudly and sprinting over to the muddy river.\n\nNora sighed and walked over to the gate between our yards.  I beat her over to the door and held it open the way I’d seen Dad do for Mom.  She let out a gentle laugh and hummed while we walked toward where Lila was already ankle deep in mud.\n\n“Your parents are really nice,” she said beside me.  “They’re helping Mom in the house.  She doesn’t usually talk to new people, but they’re good.  And you’re good too, Nathaniel.  I can tell.”\n\n“Thanks,” I said, embarrassed.  “Is your dad over there too?”\n\nHer expression lowered and I immediately knew I shouldn’t have asked that.\n\n“He’s not here.”\n\nI didn’t ask what she meant.\n\n“Come on, slowpokes!  Nate, you’re on my team for Dinosaur War!”\n\n“I’ll just watch for now,” Nora said, walking towards the swing.  “You’re just gonna get dirty.”\n\n“Too late for that,” said Lila.  “You wanna be the T-Rex, Nate?  I won't eat you too much!”\n\nI looked at her, a living fireball that jumped between the riverbanks with a surprisingly good roar, and smiled.\n\n“Sure, sounds fun.”\n\nWe played together for hours.  Lila and I clashed our toys together in the stream, making a huge mess I knew Mom wouldn’t be happy about.  I didn’t care about that though.  Laughing and playing with her was the easiest thing in the world.\n\nNora watched us from the tree swing, often asking me to come give her another push.  I carefully wiped the mud from my hands and pushed her until she was laughing too.\n\nLila would make up new games for all of us when she got bored, which happened every few minutes.  Tag.  Hide and seek.  Swordfighting with sticks.  Eventually, Nora suggested cloud watching, which Lila agreed to if the game was to find the coolest looking cloud.\n\n“That one looks like a flower.”\n\n“That one’s a racecar.”\n\n“That’s a giant snake eating the sun!  I win!”\n\n“Not everything has to be a competition,” said Nora.\n\n“True,” I agreed.  “Her’s was the coolest though.”\n\nLila smiled and jumped up to her feet.  “New game!”  She scanned the yard looking for what to do next before looking up from the swing to the top of our tree.\n\n“Lila,” said Nora.  “Don’t.  His mom said not-”\n\n“Let’s go, Nate!”  She pulled me up and towards the tree.  “Highest climber wins!”\n\nShe was off in a flash of red, scurrying up the branches so fast the squirrels my Dad hated would have been jealous.  I watched wide-eyed while Nora stepped beside me with a disapproving look.\n\n“You’re like Spider-Man!” I yelled up to her.  She looked down from her branch with a proud, toothy grin.\n\n“You bet I am!  Come on, Nate.  It’s your turn!”\n\nI felt a hand on my arm.  “Nathaniel, don’t.  We’re gonna get in trouble.”\n\n“I… I’ll be fine,” I said with as much confidence as a six year-old could muster.  “Watch.  I’m a good climber.”  One branch at a time, I slowly made my way up while Nora said something about ‘idiots.’\n\nIt took me a lot longer to reach Lila than I would have liked.  By the time I got up to her branch, she was hanging upside down and letting out a yawn I couldn’t tell was real or not.\n\n“Slowpoke.”\n\n“I still got to the same one,” I said, trying my best to balance and fighting the urge to look down.  “That means we’re tied.”\n\n“Okay then.  Next game… is the best landing!”\n\nBefore I could stop her, she pulled herself up and swung out.  She flipped through the air and landed with a clean somersault, jumping up next to her sister with a twirl and a bow.  Nora just pinched her brow and both looked up at me.\n\n“Beat that!”\n\n“Do NOT beat that!”\n\nI was still so in shock from Lila’s jump I almost didn’t realize how high up I was.  Despite my boast, I really wasn’t much of a climber.  The ground looked like it was swirling below me and the girls were little more than a pair of red and black spots.\n\nBoth of them were yelling.  Jump.  Don’t jump.  I’ll catch you.  You’ll get hurt.  Do a flip.\n\nI made up my mind.  Boys have been doing stupid stuff to impress girls since the dawn of time.  This was just my turn.\n\nI jumped.\n\nAnd I tried to do a flip.\n\nThe ground came at me faster than I realized it would.  I braced myself for the impact that honestly may have killed me, if something hadn't slowed me down.  I couldn’t move anything, but it felt like being scooped up in Dad’s arms when he would pretend to drop me and catch me at the last second.  A warm, invisible pressure trying to hold me in place.  Nora was covering her mouth, looking up at me in fear, while Lila gritted her teeth and held up both her arms.  I still hit the ground with a thud, but it was much softer than it should have been.\n\nWhen I finally looked up, my breathing was ragged, my vision still blurry.  Lila dropped her arms and fell to her knees breathing harder than I was.\n\n“Idiots,” Nora said with a mix of anger and concern.  “I told you not to do that.  Both of you.”\n\n“H-he’s fine,” Lila said between breaths.  Her eyes were wide and her forced smile was filled with worry.  “You’re fine.  Right, Nate?  P-please be fine.”\n\nI tried to move when a sharp pain came from my knee, a thin line of blood coming from a good-sized scrape.  The stinging made my fear worse.  My breaths got shorter when Nora knelt down beside me, holding my hand in hers and placing a finger just above my knee.\n\n*Shhh.  You’re okay.  Everything’s okay.  I’m right here.*\n\nHer lips didn’t move.  Her voice was clear as day while she smiled at me, but no words came from her mouth.  Her touch was cool and soothing.  The panic in my mind and the pain in my knee fell away, drowned in a wave of calm like I’d never felt before.  I looked down to see the wound was still open, but the sting was completely gone.  I tried to say something when I heard the sound of sobbing.\n\n“I-I’m sorry!” said Lila, tears welling in her eyes.  “I shouldn’t have done that.  I… I was bad.  I was bad and I got you hurt!  Please don’t be mad at me.  Please!  I didn't mean for you to fall.  I don't want to be bad.  I’m sorry!”\n\nShe was a sobbing mess when she told me “I’ll never let you get hurt again!”\n\n“It…it’s okay, Lila.  See?” I said, pointing at my knee.  “It’s like a cool battle scar.  Plus, you won, and you don’t cry if you win.”\n\nIt took a few seconds, but she smiled, for real this time, and wiped her tears on her sleeves.  “I… I did beat you, didn’t I?  Was I cool?”\n\n“The coolest.”\n\nI started to smile back at her when Nora looked at me, her grey eyes focused and sharp.\n\n“You can’t tell anyone.”\n\n“You mean Lila catching me?” I asked.  “How did she do that, and how did I hear you talk?  I feel-”\n\n“Please, don’t tell anyone!” Lila added, grabbing my other hand.  “We’ll get in a lot of trouble.”\n\n“Now you’re worried about getting in trouble?” Nora said dryly.  “Please, just promise you won’t tell.”\n\n“I-”\n\n“If you promise,” said Lila, “we’ll promise to be your best friends forever!”\n\nI looked at her and then to Nora, who smiled and nodded her head.\n\n“Okay.  I promise.”\n\nThey both smiled and spoke in unison.  “Then we promise too!  Forever!”\n\nWe all had dinner together at my house that night.  My parents asked the girls what their favorite foods were before they went to clean up.  Nora told Mom she liked chicken and noodles while Lila asked for the biggest steak we had.  Their mom told her to pick something else, but Dad looked proud of the answer and said he’d make the best steak she’d ever tasted.  The girls cleaned up back at their house and Mom gave me a bath while Dad started on the food.\n\n“So,” she said, putting a bandage on my knee from when I ‘tripped’, “you look like you had fun with the girls today.  Which one do you like more?”\n\n“Mom!”\n\n“Nora is so polite and sweet, like a little grown up.  But you had such a big smile while you and Lila chased each other.  So cute.”\n\n“Mom, I don’t like them.  Girls are gross.”\n\n“Oh, you think they're gross?  I’m gonna tell them.”\n\n“No!”\n\nShe just laughed.  I miss when she did that.\n\nDinner was delicious.  Their mom brought over a pot of breaded mac and cheese I still have the recipe too.  She apologized for not having more stuff ready to make, but Mom and Dad told her she didn’t have to make a thing.  Lila, now not covered in mud, devoured her steak like an actual dinosaur.  Nora told her mind her manners, but she smiled when she said it.  \n\nWe all played games in the living room that night.  Checkers and puzzle pieces were everywhere.  Dad eventually brought out his old guitar and played a few lines from some old song while Mom played on the piano.  I clapped along to the beat while Lila danced across the carpet.  For someone so high-energy, she moved perfectly, like she had choreographed the whole thing beforehand.  Nora sang along with my Dad, who let her take over after hearing her voice.  She didn’t just look like an angel, she sounded like one too.\n\nAnd, through it all, their mother watched her daughters, and I heard her laugh for the first time.  She wiped a tear from her tired eyes at the girls' finale, hugged them tight, and told them they were both incredible.  She complimented us as well, but my parents said the girls stole the show.  I agreed.  I couldn’t stop watching them either.\n\nThat night, after the girls had said goodnight and gone home, I had the first dream I remember having.\n\nI stepped into the hallway to get a drink of water, but I didn’t step onto our wooden floors.  Instead, my foot sank into something cold and wet.  My ears rang with the muffled sounds of men shouting echoing from both directions in the dark.  I turned back into my room just to see it wasn’t my room anymore.\n\nA young woman with black hair and a blood-stained uniform was bandaging what remained of a man’s leg. He laid silent, his blank eyes staring into mine.  She told me to grab something from the next room, so I did.\n\nI opened it and stepped onto a cobblestone street.  Smoke and soot from chimney stacks filled the night air and a girl with ragged clothes, hair like fire, and bloody knuckles grabbed my arm.  She handed me a golden chain and told me to run back to our hiding spot, so I did.\n\nEvery room was a new scene, a new place, and new, terrible orders wrapped up in loving whispers and joy-filled laughter.\n\nI climbed on the ship.  Go below deck.\nI ran through the woods.  Go to the church.\nI walked through the halls.  Go to her room.\n\nI did everything I was told.  I still do everything I’m told.  I am so sick of doing everything I'm told.\n\nEventually, once my legs felt like they would fall out from under me, I stopped and sat.\n\nThe smell of rain and wet grass filled the air while I sat on a rock.  Behind me in the distance, small hearths burned in a village I couldn’t remember the name of, if it even had a name, but I knew it was mine.  In front of me was a field giving way to rolling foothills and mountains.  Their silhouettes stood out like a void against the bright blanket of stars filling the sky.  I had never seen so many while I was awake, and even more appeared as the last rays of sunlight fell behind the horizon.  I laid on my back and looked up to the heavens, mesmerized.\n\nThen, heaven fell.  Stars showered across the sky, dancing in a performance just for me.  Most faded back into the darkness, but two, burning silver and more beautiful than the others, struck the mountain.  I grabbed my crook and left my flock.  I walked to the place where the stars came to Earth.\n\nWhen I reached the base, two lights glided down from the peaks.  One traveled slowly while the other danced among the trees.  Both headed towards me.\n\nWhen they neared me, I screamed.  They had twisted, shimmering forms like water and smoke clouding my eyes.  Staring at them cracked my mind like stone.  The sound of river rapids rushed in my ears and my bones felt crushed by the air itself.  One reached out to me, the light so bright it didn’t matter how hard I closed my eyes.  I fell on my face and begged them to leave or kill me or whatever they would do as long the pain stopped, my cries coming out in a language I didn't know.  They whispered to each other in voices like thunder.  The light dimmed and the pain went away.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the figures my mind wouldn't let me remember we're gone.  In their place stood two young women, their bare skin glowing like dawn and dusk.  Their eyes belonged in the skies, their shifting faces beautiful and just human enough to fool me.\n\n“I’m very sorry,” said *The Burning One*, a name I knew but hadn't heard.  “I didn't mean to hurt you.”\n\n“You do not think, sister,” said *The Shadow Out of Heaven*. “Must I follow you everywhere?”\n\n“I didn't know they would be so… weak.”\n\n“You have watched them.  They are fragile and…” She rubbed her arms while her sister shivered. “...freezing.”\n\nI offered my cloak to one and what furs I could spare to the other.  They huddled close while I prepared a fire.  I gave them food from my pack and bowed before them.\n\n“Are you goddesses?”\n\n*What is a goddess to you?* came a voice in my mind.  I looked up at the two of them, the light from their bodies dimming further, save for the eyes that stared through my soul.\n\n“A god is…” I hesitated, unsure of what to say to them, “... something powerful.  Something to be worshipped.  Their chosen ones leave them offerings and the gods give blessings and gifts.”\n\n“You may call us that,” one said, stones twirling in the air between her fingers.  “Are you a god then?  You’re the one giving gifts, not us.”\n\n“No, I’m a man.”\n\n“We have watched you all for a time,” said the other, her eyes fixed on me. “My sister wanted to know more, and I am curious too.  These forms are… interesting.”\n\n“There are many of us down the mountain.  I can lead you there.”\n\n“Not without a gift from us!” Her voice wasn't threatening, but it boomed throughout the valley.  The cool wind itself followed her voice, rustling against the furs I'd given her. \n\n“Gods give gifts, right?!”\n\n“You are too loud, sister, but you are right.”\n\n“As always!”\n \n“Though, we have nothing to give for your kindness,” she said, wrapping my cloak tighter around herself.\n\n“Then we will find things!” She turned to me, her smile beaming.  “And you will be my chosen!\n\n“Perhaps he would choose me instead, sister.”\n\nThe light began to shine in their eyes and the pain in my mind and bones began again.\n\n“I… can be both.” They looked at me, eyes dimming.  I bowed to these living things the way the elders bowed to their idols.  “It would… be an honor.  If it would please you.”\n\nThey looked to each, then back to me, and nodded.  We would wait for daybreak to move, so I closed my eyes while feeling theirs on me.\n\nI woke up to the sound of a doorbell ringing, tucked into bed like I’d never left it.  I walked downstairs to see Lila and Nora standing with their mother while she gave a quick thank you to Mom and ran out the door.\n\n“Nate!  Mom got called into work today.  Let’s go play!”\n\n“We should eat breakfast first, Lila.  Thank you, Nathaniel's Mom.”\n\n“No problem, girls,” Mom said with a smile.  “Nathan, change your clothes and come downstairs.  We're making pancakes.”\n\n“Be fast, Nate!”\n\n“Don't keep us waiting.”\n\nI did what I was told, my dream fading from my mind when the smell of sugar and syrup filled the air.  It's amazing what a kid’s mind will just accept and move on from.  Ignorance really is bliss.\n\nTheir mom worked at the hospital and always picked up shifts when she could.  There were times the girls spent more nights sleeping over in our living room than their own beds. Mom and Dad never said a word though.  I think they knew how hard their mom was trying.  I once saw her try to give my parents a piece of paper from her wallet, but they smiled and told her to keep it.\n\nThey quickly became the center of my world.  Summer was riding bikes around the neighborhood, Lila always seeming to rebalance herself on a turn where she should have fallen, and Nora telling us to slow down while she smiled.\n\nFall meant rides to school in Dad's car, jumping into piles of leaves, and Nora wanting to watch scary movies next to me on the couch while Lila hid behind me.\n\nWinter was filled with snowmen and snow angels.  I’d throw a snowball at Lila and it would orbit her like a planet before shooting back at my face.  When Nora stood next to me, I didn't know if it was her gift warming me up or something else.\n\nSpring brought back warmer weather, swimming down at the river, and a huge birthday party with all our friends.  We shared a birthday.  What are the odds?\n\nI’d give anything to go back, even if it meant ending up where I am now.  Seeing Lila's smile when she made a goal in the backyard.  Hearing Nora read a story to me under the shade of the old tree.  They were just girls then, their names were just Lila and Nora, and I was just the idiot boy next door who didn't know what was coming.\n\nWe were us.\n\nThe air feels heavy.  *She’ll* be home soon.  I’ll make her something sweet, warm up the tub on the deck, and get the wine glasses ready.  My offerings to her.\n\nI don't know what’s gonna happen to me now, what she's gonna do to me, but I’ll hope for the best and write again when I can.  \n\nMy goddess is almost here.\n\nDon't waste your prayers on me.",

    "content": "(Part  2: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1onlec8/something\\_disgusting\\_is\\_happening\\_in\\_my\\_new\\_house/)\n\nToday is my first day back to the house after Jason’s disappearance. I was honestly shocked to see that upon walking in, the place is spotless. With everything I’ve been through, the last week has been such a system shock, I actually forgot to tell my landlord anything about what happened. But it makes sense that the police would have contacted him. The hours that morphed into the last 5 days have all been a blur. At the risk of monotony, I’ll skip over the police escort to the station and subsequent hours of in-depth questioning by detectives. I was given the opportunity to drive myself but my car was still out for the count. I began to feel ill; I wanted to hurl in the back of the police car.\n\nJason's parents, who we later learned were the ones who called his phone when we found it in that filth, were notified of his disappearance. From what the detectives told me, they were devastated. Somehow I feel responsible. I fear that they blame me for his fate. And under the circumstances, it would only be reasonable to blame the one and only person Jason was last with. I was given the opportunity to speak to them over the phone at the station, but I couldn’t bring myself to. I don’t know if that makes me a coward. \n\nThe detectives let me go as there was no evidence actually tying me to whatever happened to Jason. But they told me under no circumstances was I to leave the county. Because I couldn't return home I was forced to either find a hotel or ask someone to allow me to stay with them. I didn’t have any family in the immediate area so my choices were slim. So I decided to call John. \n\nJohn is a good guy. A strange guy, but still good. I met him over Facebook about two years ago and we kind of just hit it off. I’ve been to his house a couple of times in the past, but not recently. Met his wife, she’s the hippie type, dreads, circle-brimmed glasses and a very chill vibe. They both are obsessed with mushrooms, both functional and psychedelic to the point that they have a monotub in their garage. Beyond being a fungus-obsessed weirdo, he also happens to be one of the smartest guys I know, with a job title to match his IQ and fungal interests: agricultural mycologist.\n\nBut if it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have found the house I’m in now. He actually sent me the listing for it over Facebook Messenger because he knew I was looking for a place to call my own that wasn’t a cramped apartment. So for that I’m grateful.\n\nWhen I called him from outside the police station and explained what happened, he was of course shocked. John and Jason were mutual friends through me, so they weren’t particularly close. Nonetheless, he was upset by the news, at least at first. From explaining how I found Jason gone to my panicked 911 call and then being questioned, John was tracking with me. I could feel his grief and shock palpably through the phone. However, he got really hung up on the black ooze when I mentioned it only briefly. In fact when I brought it up, his tone shifted from grief to a near inappropriate amount of intrigue.\n\n“So, tell me more about the stuff you found in your living room,” he said, almost excitedly.\n\nI felt a little uncomfortable and hesitated to go into more detail. I found it to be in poor taste that he sounded this curious over the disgusting stuff rather than focusing on our missing friend.\n\n“Uh, I mean it was black, and it had like roots or veins or something like that in it,” I said.\n\n“Did it look dry and fuzzy? Or like wet and viscous, like jello?” he followed up quickly.\n\nI had a quick flashback to my nightmare and I gagged at the thought. The nausea I felt before boiled up again in my stomach. “Oh, God, I don’t know, man. Like jello I guess.”\n\n“What about the smell, how did it smell?” he said, nearly manic now.\n\n“Listen, I know that stuff like this doesn’t really gross you out because you work with nasty shit all the time. But I really don’t want to think about it right now,” I said, fully wanting to get off the phone at this point. I contemplated not asking to stay at his house at all. \n\n“Ah, I’m sorry, Mark,” he said, like someone says when they’re caught flirting. “I got a little carried away.”\n\nThere was an awkward pause in the conversation after that. I felt like he was about to say goodbye when I finally spoke up.\n\n“Well, the last thing I want to do is inconvenience you,” I began. In a fraction of a second I had a debate with myself whether I should ask to stay with him or not. “But while my house is still a crime scene, I can’t really go back there right now. I hate to ask this, but would it be okay if you gave me a ride to a hotel? My car’s being a POS right now.” The words flowed out of my mouth, but I felt strangely relieved to say them.\n\nThere was another awkward pause and then,\n\n“Yeah, I can do that,” he said. I was relieved to hear that. “But I’m going to need some gas money.” And the feeling of relief fled me like a cat from water. “Really?” I thought. But I nevertheless agreed.\n\nWe exchanged a couple more words before ending the call. He swung by to pick me up about a half hour later. I hopped into his car and he immediately surprised me by reaching back behind his seat and pulling out a backpack. He handed it to me and explained that he felt bad that I couldn’t go home to collect my things. So he had quickly packed a “go bag” for me. He told me it had two changes of clothes, some basic hygiene supplies and even some snacks. I was really touched by the gesture and before we got to the hotel that would end up being my home for four days, we stopped for lunch at the nearest fast food joint. I tried to eat, but I could hardly bring myself to. I was starting to feel ill, my stomach was upset. I chalked it up to my grief making itself known or my adrenaline finally coming down. \n\nThe hotel room was cozy yet sterile. I plopped the bag John gave me on the bed and I decided to take a shower. I stayed in the shower for a long time, just letting the hot water run over me mulling over the last 24 hours. Suddenly, I felt my stomach churn. My intestines felt like they were twisting inside me and I buckled over in pain. A flash of nausea started in my stomach and spread throughout my entire body, leading to my throat. The hot water turned from a source of comfort to now unbearable overstimulation. My mouth reluctantly opened, like the jaws of a dog being pried open by its owner, and I began to heave. My lunch came up first, pieces of ground beef and bread soaked in a sickly dark-colored bile. Then, I heaved again, my whole body tensed and my stomach cramped, feeling like it would collapse in on itself. The echoes of my uncontrollable moans reverberated off the tight shower walls. A black liquid poured out of my mouth accompanied by pale strands of unknown origin. Their texture was that of a network of soft roots or a tangle of undercooked spaghetti. They slowly inched up my esophagus and out my mouth. A bulk of them got caught in my throat as my body desperately tried to expel them with each contraction of my core. The veins dangled from my mouth and I knew that I had to do something to get them out of me. So I wrapped my hands around them and pulled. The feeling was terrible; I had nothing left to puke as I dry heaved and gagged at the sensation of the slimy strands sliding out my throat. I felt as though this torture would never end and I continued to pull inch by inch out of me. Finally, it all came out and hit the shower floor with a disgusting limp slap. \n\nI stayed in my hunched-over position for a long moment, catching my breath. The water washed away much of the black bile, leaving behind chunks of undigested food and the curled-up snake-shaped mass I had just pulled out of my stomach. It had to have been at least two feet long. Two feet of tangled mess, two feet of who knows what, from who knows where, inside me. My panic subsided and I started to shake. After watching the particles of burger and bun wash away and down the drain I left the shower, collapsing onto my bed, still wet. Without thinking of calling for an ambulance, my exhausted body fell into a long undisturbed sleep. When I finally woke up, the sun had gone down. I grabbed my phone and checked the time: 8:30 pm. I slept for nearly 8 hours straight. I got up and went into the bathroom. I cautiously peeked my head into the shower and saw nothing. It was gone. The strands I had thought I had pulled out of my mouth had disappeared. Was this all another nightmare? Had I just fallen asleep after a normal shower and dreamed up the rest? I desperately wanted that to be the answer, so I convinced myself that it was. I mean, I felt way better than before, no nausea or weakness and my appetite had returned tenfold.\n\nI pilfered through John’s “go bag” searching for the food he claimed to have put in it. I found nothing but clothes and a piece of folded-up paper in one of its side pockets. At this point I was sufficiently annoyed with him. I placed the paper on the bed and took the clothes out. After I got dressed I snatched up the trifolded paper and lifted the first fold. It was a printout from a pharmacy with John’s wife’s name on the top. Below her name I saw the name of the medication, “Gemzar”. I googled Gemzar and the search result floored me. It was a chemotherapy medication for advanced breast cancer. I was flooded with a mix of emotions. I felt like I had invaded their privacy and I was angry at myself for ever being mad at John. And I felt an immense amount of pity for him and his wife. I just laid down and stared up at the ceiling. I had a lot of time to think in my hotel room. About Jason, where he might be, what might have happened to him. About John and his life, how hard and hectic it must be.  The five days went by without any more strangeness. I received a call from the detective informing me that they hadn’t found Jason. \n\n“Search and Rescue had lost his trail about a quarter of a mile away from your house,” he said. I could hear the bafflement in his voice. “At this stage, we’ll keep the case open, but there really isn’t much more we can do. I’m sorry Mark, I know this must feel all so overwhelming,” he said, attempting to sympathize with me. The only prints they found of the broken plates and in the living room relating to the struggle were his own. \n\n“What about the black stuff? In my living room and outside?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, that’s a mystery to just about everybody at this point,” he said. “Forensics took samples of it and, while it might take a while to hear anything conclusive, we’re trying to get to the bottom of it. But, you’re free to return home.”\n\nI didn’t feel relieved. I wanted answers. I stayed at the hotel last night. I didn’t need to, but I wanted to. It was a small escape from the reality of my missing friend. I took an Uber this morning to my house; I didn’t feel like asking John. Our last interaction was weird and I just wanted to respect his space. He was clearly dealing with his wife and maintaining their privacy must be hard, I didn’t want to invade more than I already had. \n\nLike I said, my house is spotless. There was a SERVPRO business card left on my kitchen counter with the slogan “Like it never even happened” printed in bold. The sludge is gone—well actually the whole rug it was on is missing, but that’s alright with me. Oddly, that mildewy smell is back, but just as faint, I’ve just accepted it’s part of the house now. The broken dishes and strewn about utensils are either gone or put away. My house looks just about how it was when I first settled in. The only thing that’s bothering me now are Jason, or that lacking of him rather, and my landlord's response after I texted him, thanking him for hiring a cleaning crew. He got back to me a minute ago. His message says, “What are you talking about? I didn’t hire a crew to clean your house.” Now he’s calling me.",

    "content": "Alcove Mall. I can’t say I’ve heard of it, but according to friends and family, it was something special. It was two hours away from where I live, and from what I’ve heard from other people, it seemed like a cool place to hang out. One of my brother’s friends said he’d take girls here on dates, hit the food court, watch a movie, and then sneak off somewhere to have sex. Then the late 90s hit, and the mall started tanking. The rent got higher to try and stay afloat, but unfortunately, the store vendors couldn’t keep up. One by one, the stores closed; it was like an organ failure. The final nail in the coffin was the movie theater, which was independently owned and was the only theater for miles. Then, it was announced that a Regal Cinema would be opening soon. Fourteen screens, IMAX included. \n\nAfter that, game over. I only know this stuff because my family loved to talk about memories they had while they drove past it. My older brothers would talk about girls they met, movies they saw, the arcade, and so forth. Dad talked about how good the food court was, and he kept going on about how he wished he had caved in and bought one of those massage chairs they always had on display. Mom, she always said she loved reading by the indoor fountains, listening to the water ripple and splash. I thought it’d be demolished by someone by now, but it just stands there on the side of the road like some sort of commercialistic monolith to 80s Americana. \n\nI was in college, cash was drying up, and Christmas was getting close. After being laid off from Walmart, my savings started to dwindle quickly. Between tuition fees and everyday expenses, I was trying to manage without going broke. I eventually moved back in with Mom & Dad while I was searching for a job. I’d refresh Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, the works. All the jobs were the same: fast food, car sales, and janitorial positions. I was about to bite the bullet and apply to be a janitor when I refreshed the page one more time and saw a new listing:\n\n**NIGHT MONITOR FOR ALCOVE MALL**\n\n**FULL-TIME**\n\n**MON-FRI**\n\n**6:00 pm - 5:00 am**\n\n**100$ AN HOUR**\n\n**DESCRIPTION: Night Monitors are to survey the premises and keep the mall safe and secure. Monitors must be willing to stay awake throughout the night to ensure that this historic establishment is safe from vandals and will remain adequate until its eventual sale**\n\nI instantly applied. 1,100$ a night? Ain’t no way I’m not skipping out on this. Something I didn’t expect was to get a response. I surely thought they’d hire a former cop, bodyguard, or whatever other tough guy they’d have fill in the position. But to my surprise, I got a call. I answered,\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Are you the one who applied for the Nightwatchmen position at Alcove Mall?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The name is Mick. I saw the application you sent in, and after careful consideration, I think I'm gonna hire you.\"\n\nMy jaw hung open, and I was at a loss for words. I was just glad that I had a source of income for the first time in months. \n\n\"I understand you know what your duties are, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, do you have a ballpark for when I'll be able to start?\"\n\n\"Monday, if that's okay with you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, man, cool. Do I need to go through any training videos or dress in a uniform?\"\n\n\"You wear the clothes on your back along with an orange vest. I'll mail it to you along with a set of keys to the place.\"\n\nOut of curiosity, I asked,\n\n\"Do I get a gun?\"\n\nThe voice laughed,\n\n\"Good lord, you ain't a cop, you just watch the place. However, I would advise you to bring something with you. Baseball bat, mace, taser, anything like that. We get our fair share of squatters and most are harmless, but you don't want to be empty-handed on the chance one of them ain't. But these little run-ins don't happen that often, though, I'd pack something to read or listen to. Boredom is your worst enemy for a job like this.\"\n\n\"Right. Is there anything else I should know?\"\n\nMick was silent for a second, and he cleared his throat,\n\n\"Well, my last night watchman quit because he said he saw ghosts or some shit.\"\n\n\"So, it's haunted?\"\n\n\"Allegedly. But I guarantee you it was just some of the squatters, that, or some kids playing a prank. You're not skittish about that stuff, are you?\"\n\n\"Uh, no, I'm good. I don't really believe in ghosts.\"\n\n\"Thank God. The last guy drove me fucking nuts about this superstitious paranormal shit. Best of luck, kid.\"\n\n\"I'm twenty-nine.\"\n\n\"...Okay...Bye...\"\n\nEventually, the mail came: a bright orange reflective vest, along with a set of keys, all of them discolored with age. Phone calls and applications are one thing, but actually receiving my vest just made it a little more real. Dad walked by, patted me on the back, and congratulated me. Mom made me supper to take with me. I had a thermos full of chicken noodle soup, a spoon, and a bowl. As for entertainment, I brought my phone, a charger, and a Bluetooth speaker with me, as well as a copy of 'Outer Dark' by Cormac McCarthy. I also brought an aluminum baseball bat. I was set, I pounded an energy drink and went off to my new job.\n\nI knew it wouldn't be a looker, but the damn place was rough-looking. The exterior was covered in moss, rain stains, and cracks. The entrance had faded signage and milk colored glass. I looked towards the keys in my pocket and fiddled for the right one to unlock the front entrance. Once inside, it was darker than I expected. Usually, malls have skylights, but I found my answer when I looked up to find that the skylights were darkened by leaves and rainwater. There were only scant little dots of light that pierced through; the floor almost looked like it was decorated in stars. \n\nThe interior, remarkably, was unscathed by the outdoors. Now, it wasn't perfect, not by any stretch of the imagination. The air was musty, dust coated everything, and I was most certainly convinced there were rats in here scurrying about and digging around. The size of this place was immense; although it was only a single story, the vast amount of open space gave it an almost temple-like appearance. It felt like I was walking on hallowed ground, and in a way, I was; this used to be people's whole world back in the day. I walked around admiring old stores that I'd not seen in the better part of a decade, some I'd never even heard of at all. But it was interesting, the whole place was frozen in time, it was kind of tragic, really. This place used to be full of people, and now it's a husk. \n\nI got a phone call, the sound was so loud that I nearly jumped out of my skin. I reached for it and saw it was Mick,\n\n\"You there, kid?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Have you found where your station is?\"\n\n\"I just walked in ten minutes ago, and this place is pretty damn big, so no.\"\n\n\"Well, it's set up in the food court. We put up a site cabin in the food court. It's dead center in the mall, you can't miss it. If you're lost, follow the mall maps.\"\n\n\"Thanks again. Hey, just curious, why the food court?\"\n\n\"Hm. Well, we had a security room, equipped with cameras and everything. Then we got black mold, moisture tore up the cameras, and...listen, it just went to shit, okay?\"\n\n\"Sorry, didn't mean to pry.\"\n\n\"Eh, you're fine, kid. Just find your post and settle in.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mick.\"\n\n\"No problem.\"\n\nI walked down the mall corridors, noticing the glimmers of lights from the obscured skylights were starting to change color, and more importantly, they were starting to dim. I whipped out my flashlight and turned it on; the harsh, pale light illuminated the floors and walls brilliantly. I definitely got my money's worth when I bought it on sale; the damn thing was like a mini sun. I followed the corridor until I came to a large opening. A busted-up plastic sign above the entrance read: 'FOOD COURT'. In the center was exactly what Mick said would be there, a site cabin. Dark green windows and a generator next to it to give it power.\n\nI flicked it on, and the lights within the cabin blasted through the windows and onto the floor of the court. All around me was a massive array of overturned tables, chairs, trash, and cracked tiled floors. It was just peachy. I entered the cabin and found it strangely welcoming. The rest of the mall was dark, damp, and just plain creepy. This was a small room with comforting warm lights and enough room to kick back and relax.\n\nThe first few hours were extremely boring. I made my rounds, took notes on any suspicious activity or any signs of forced entry. I came across some graffiti of a pig in a cop uniform, a graveyard with cartoon ghosts, and lastly a shittly drawn swastika that someone x'ed out with red paint. I returned to the site cabin and looked at my phone for the time: 9:59 pm. \n\n\"Jesus Christ.\"\n\nI decided to take a seat and read some chapters of 'Outer Dark'. I was listening to Bruce Springsteen over the Bluetooth speaker, and that's when I heard a very loud and visible scream from the dark. I fell backwards from my chair and landed on the floor with a thud. I could hear the reverberations of the scream still echoing in the mall's emptiness. I got myself up, reached for my bat, and ran into the mall. I clicked on the flashlight, waving it around me to see if I could spot anything. \n\n\"Hey! Show yourself!\"\n\nI got no reply. So I went around, looking through every corner of the mall. My first thought was that some little fucker thought it'd be funny to scare the new nightwatch guy. Another thought I had was that someone broke in and got scared by a rat, or worse, hurt. Yet, I spent an entire hour looking the mall up and down. The stores, the food court, the theater, everywhere. No one. Not a sign of a person. I didn't let my mind wander to the paranormal. If anything, I was pissed someone screamed, scared the shit out of me, and dipped.\n\nThe rest of the night was thankfully uneventful. I made it halfway through the book when Mick called, \n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"How're you holding up? You only have two hours to go.\"\n\n\"Fine. Some jackass came into the store and screamed. Scared the shit out of me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, probably some teens, they get their jollies on seeing workers scared.\"\n\n\"Why are you up so late?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nI didn't respond to it and just changed the subject.\n\n\"Everything is good besides that. There's some graffiti near the K&B Toys, the Spencers, and the uh...Hot Topic.\"\n\n\"Noted. I'll have some guys clean it up during the day. You're doing great, kid, you're doing great. Remember to be back at the same time tomorrow, okay?\"\n\nI collapsed into my bed when I came home. I had no dreams, but I awoke feeling sore and tired from all of the walking I did yesterday. I returned the next day and was less creeped out by the interior this time. However, I did take note of something I had never noticed the first night. The mall must've closed during Christmas. Hanging from the ceiling were threads of tinsel of red, green, and gold. There were delapitated trees decorated in bulbs that were sometimes whole and sometimes broken. And when I walked past the stores, I noticed that they were themed for Christmas. Then I walked past. The theater was even showing *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*, and on top of the marquee, there was a massive sign that said,\n\n'HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM ALCOVE MALL!'\n\n\"How the fuck did I miss that?\" I murmured to myself.\n\nThe night was normal, I finished my book, and started another. This time I chose to read 'The Ninth Configuration'. Unlike the last book, I finished this one in one sitting, and I was left just listening to music the rest of the night. It was boring, but I could handle boring if it meant getting paid.\n\nThe next day, something new happened: I found six teens smoking weed near the fountain where my Mom used to read. There was a nativity scene with a plastic Jesus, Mary & Joseph. The kids were halfway through talking about how creepy the mall was when I turned the flashlight on them, and they scurried away like roaches before I could say anything to them. When I turned around to look at the fountain, I saw a face staring at me from the ceiling. Stark white with black eyes. I almost screamed, but when I looked closer, it was angelic but plastic. I pointed the flashlight at the rest of it and realized it was an angel, dangling from the ceiling. Golden wings, red robe, yellow hair, & she even had a little halo attached to the crown of her head.\n\n“How in the fuck did I miss you?!”\n\nI got up, brushed myself off, and walked around to finish looking over everything else before I went back to the site cabin. Oddly enough, this looked more Christmassy. The store windows had little advertisements for holiday sales, and there was more holiday decor within the gutted stores. Turned over plastic Santa’s, styrofoam snowmen, and there were even paper snowflakes hanging from within the stores. And strangely, all of this felt new, but it couldn’t have been new. Everything was old, weathered, and aged by time. \n\nI returned to the cabin to find a rat sniffing my thermos,\n\n“HEY, GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!”\n\nIt scurried away, and I shoed it out of the room. I sat in my chair and texted Mick about the kids. He just sent a thumbs-up emoji. I got three chapters into Under the Dome when a loud electronic screech assaulted my ears. I clasped my hands over them and gritted my teeth until it stopped. It took me a second to realize what it was.\n\nIt was the Mall’s sound system, turning on. Then, it started to play music:\n\n*Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy*\n*Do you hear what I hear?*\n*(Do you hear what I hear?)*\n\nMy skin began to crawl as Bing Crosby’s voice played on the scratchy speakers and echoed into the grand emptiness that was Alcove Mall. I called Mick, but he didn’t answer. The song continued, so I grabbed my bat and headed to the control room. I don’t give a shit about the mold; somebody was fucking with me. I ran down to where the control room was, busted open the door to find…nothing. I pulled my shirt up over my nose as I observed the dead equipment that littered the room. Then, just as abruptly as it started, the music was gone.\n\nWhen I awoke the next evening, I had a missed text. I opened it to check who it was from, and I saw Mick’s contact.\n\n**U TRY TO CALL ME?**\n\nI replied,\n\n**yeah, someone was playing music over the speakers in the mall. Went to check but found no one**\n\n**WEIRD**\n\n**Can the speakers be turned on?**\n\n**NOT AT THIS POINT, THEY PROBABLY WOULDN’T WORK**\n\n**well, they worked just fine last night.**\n\n**WELL IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, KEEP ME POSTED**\n\n**Sure thing.**\n\n\nThe next night got stranger. I went inside, and this time, there was a little metal sign pointing towards the center of the mall: ‘MEET SANTA CLAUS!’\n\nI gripped my baseball bat a little tighter and headed for the site cabin, I was sure that this wasn’t here before, but maybe I was just tired, or stressed, or whatever the fuck. At this point, the Christmas stuff was starting to make me worry about my own Christmas shopping. My brother Stephen had been wanting a new pair of steel-toed boots for his work, but Mom said she didn’t want anything but made it abundantly clear she wanted a new sewing machine. Then there was my Dad, who was impossible to buy for; whatever he needed, he bought himself. While I was in the cabin, I fell asleep. I know we weren’t supposed to sleep on the job, but it was just one of those sudden things. I don’t know if it was sleep deprivation or not, but I just went. \n\nThe speakers turned on, music played again, it was Gene Autry:\n\n*Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane*\n\nI jolted awake and grabbed my bat in a singular motion. I left the cabin, bat in one hand, flashlight in the other, looking around. I walked on, looking around the old Christmas decorations, waiting to see somebody with a speaker, CD player, record player, whatever the fuck could’ve been playing music this loud. I didn’t want to believe it was the speakers, Mick said it himself that they didn’t work. Yet, here I was listening to *Here Comes Santa Claus* in a dead mall.\n\nI turned the corner and was stopped in my tracks. There, by the fountain, was a setup to meet Santa Claus. There was damped fake snow, decrepit fake trees, and a red throne. In front of it all was an old camera & a withered flash umbrella.\n\nThis wasn’t here before; this time, I was sure of it. Yet, all of it was old, like it had been here since it closed. But I know I’m not crazy, right? Maybe someone put these here, got them from a storage closet, and placed them. That was the only explanation. Then, in the distance behind the 'Meet Santa', barely visible to my light within the dark was something that made my skin break out in gooseflesh. I had to have been hallucinating, but I could've sworn I saw a man dressed up in a Santa outfit. The jolly red suit was filthy, and the fake beard was dangling from a face that I couldn't see. I shouted,\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nThe figure did not move, the song began to skip, repeating the same phrase over and over,\n\n*Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus*\n\nIt began to run at me, fast. The boots were clopping onto the floor like horse hooves on cobblestone streets. I wish I could've told you that I was heroic and stood my ground. I dropped my bat and ran as fast as I could back to the site cabin. I could hear it running behind me, the boots thudding growing closer, too close. All while the sadistic, repetitive Christmas jingle blasted through the distorted speakers. I made it to the food court and slammed the door behind me, locking it back. I waited for something to start pounding at the door...but nothing came. The music stopped, but I just sat there in the cabin, waiting. I wasn't taking any chances whatsoever; I'm pretty sure I was petrified in fear. \n\nEventually, I fell asleep. I don't know when or how, but I did. I was awoken by a phone call from Mick.\n\n\"Hey, what's going on, kid?\"\n\n\"Mick, someone broke into the mall and chased me!\"\n\nHis voice got very low and serious,\n\n\"Tell me everything. I'll call the police if I have to.\"\n\n\"It's one guy, he's wearing an old Santa outfit, and...I just got freaked out, man! I just ran!\"\n\n\"Shhhh! Calm down. Is he still in the Mall?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, I think so!\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. Right now it's...it's three AM, just call it and go home, okay? I'll chip in a bonus for you for Christmas, sound good?\"\n\nI didn't know what was crazier, the bonus or having me just try to walk out of here when that guy was still here. I just responded with a simple,\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Good. I'll call the police; they'll be there shortly. You can't stay where you are, you're gonna have to let them in.\"\n\n\"O-okay, I-I can do this.\"\n\n\"Stay strong, kid.\"\n\nI shone my flashlight out of the windows of the cabin to see if anything was waiting for me outside. There was nothing. I grabbed the keys and ran for the exit. The moment I left the cabin, the music started up again, the scratchy speakers blaring a new song,\n\n*Do you hear what I hear? Said the night wind to the little lamb, Do you see what I see?*\n\nI was running past the fountain and looked at the nativity scene near it. Everything was where it was, except that the angel that was suspended above them. It was gone. I felt fear jolt through my body like lightning, and I continued to run. The song began to skip,\n\n*Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear? Do you hear what I hear?*\n\nWithin the dead stores, I saw dull Christmas lights start to illuminate the path before me, and that's when I heard great swooshes from behind me. It sounded like a pair of great wings rising and falling. I looked behind me. Within the dark, barely lit halls of Alcove Mall, the plastic angel was flying above me. Her plastic shell was lit by dull reds and greens, and the artificial wings, defying all common sense, flapped like some mythical bird. The door was so close; I had to make it. My legs were aching, but I pushed through the pain until I reached the door. I scrambled for the keys, the sound of the wings grew closer, and the music loudly taunted me with the repeated phrase over and over. I found the right key and sprinted into the night air.\n\nI was gasping when I exited the mall, sucking down all of the freezing cold air. Sirens were wailing in the distance, and I felt a relief that I'd not felt before or since. I pointed towards the mall and told them everything. I sounded hysterical, and I was, to be honest, who wouldn't be after experiencing what I did. Mick showed up shortly after, and to make sure I was okay. By the time they searched the building up and down, they didn't see anyone, and asked me for the Mall Santa's description, but I couldn't give anything other than what he was wearing. I didn't mention the plastic angel; no one would believe me if I did. After they wrote up the report, Mick turned to me and said he'd treat me to Breakfast.\n\nThe Waffle House was empty, its yellow lights illuminating the wet asphalt of the parking lot. Mick covered the meal, and I got eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and some waffles. He got waffles, sunnyside-up eggs, and ham. We ate in silence until he asked,\n\n\"You gonna be okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"I'll be hiring more help soon. Less work, more free days.\"\n\nI didn't know whether this was a blessing or not, considering I'd have to go back. I came close to telling him I wanted to quit, but the money was good, especially with the holidays coming up and tuition still piling up. I just said,\n\n\"I appreciate it.\"\n\n\"Hey, you've got the next two weeks off, enjoy Christmas. And expect that bonus soon.\"\n\n\"Funny, I kinda don't want to think about Christmas anymore.\"\n\n\"Aw, how come?\"\n\n\"Because of all the Christmas shit in the mall, the decorations, the ads, the music...\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"You're joking, the whole place was full of decorations!\"\n\n\"...Kid, we stripped that mall of everything years ago. All that's left on the walls and ceiling is just old paint.\"\n\nI am writing this because I know what I saw. I know that Mick means well, but he wouldn't believe me. I'm not sure my family would believe me either. But right now, I awoke first on Christmas morning to get the presents ready for everyone to open, and I found one I didn't recognize. It was an oblong box with old school-looking wrapping paper, and it simply read,\n\nFROM SANTA CLAUS\n\nI opened it, and I found my baseball bat. The same one I dropped on the filthy mall floor two weeks ago. Beneath it was a Christmas themed gift card that read,\n\n*IT'S ALWAYS CHRISTMAS AT ALCOVE MALL!*",

    "title": "My Four Year Old Son Has An Imaginary Friend Called \"The Tall Boy\"",
    "excerpt": "I need help. I don't know where else to turn, and I know how this is going to sound, but I'm terrified for my son. This ...",
    "content": "I need help. I don't know where else to turn, and I know how this is going to sound, but I'm terrified for my son.\n\nThis morning, my four year old looked at me over his untouched cereal and said \"Daddy, the tall boy says he can take me to see momma.\" \n\nMy wife died last year. A car accident. My son barely remembers her.\n\nLet me back up.\n\nIt started about six months ago. My son, I'll call him C started talking about a new friend. At first, I thought it was sweet. He's an only child, i work from home and honestly i thought maybe i wasn't doing enough to socialize him. Kids his age have imaginary friends right? Honestly I was kinda relived he had some one to play with, even if it was just pretend. \n\nHe called him \"The Tall Boy\" \n\nThe name was a little odd, but hes only four so I didn't give it much thought. I asked C what  the tall boy looked like. He just shrugged and said. \"He's tall.\" All right then.\n\nFor the first month it was harmless. C would have conversations with empty air, he would giggle at jokes i couldn't hear, and he would often be sitting on one side of the room playing with his toys, and he would always set out a toy for \"the tall boy.\" When I would ask him what they would talk about he'd say. \"Just stuff, he's my friend.\"  \n\n\nThen he started setting a place for Tall Boy at dinner.\n\nAn extra plate, an extra cup, and he would get upset if i didn't leave an empty chair next to him. \"That's where Tall Boy sits.\" He would say looking at me like i was being rude or something. So naturally I went along with it, what else was i supposed to do? it wasn't hurting anything for me to set out an extra plate and cup for dinner. \n\nThe first red flag came about two months in.\n\nWe were reading before bed, and out of nowhere C says. \"The Tall Boy says you had a dog named Dakota when you were little.\" \n\nI stared at him for a moment. I did have a dog named Dakota when I was a kid but he died when I was a teenager there's no way he would know that, I've never told him I had a dog. I don't even have photos of Dakota, and my wife never met Dakota. There's no way that he could've known. \n\n\"Who told you that?\" I asked trying to keep my voice steady. \n\n\"The Tall Boy.\" He said like it was obvious. \n\nI told myself maybe I'd mentioned it before and just forgot. maybe he heard me on the phone with my sister or something. I was looking for any rational explanation.  \n  \nBut then he said. \"The Tall Boy says he got hit my a truck.\"\n\nThe hairs on the back of my neck stood up. That's exactly how Dakota died. I was at school. My mom told me he had run away because she thought I was too young to know the truth. I didn't find out the truth until I was sixteen.\n\n\"C, where did you hear that?\"\n\n\"The Tall Boy told me.\" He said and went back to looking at the book like he had just told me the sky is blue.\n\nI started to pay more attention after that.\n\nC talked to The Tall Boy constantly. In his room, in the living room, even in the bathroom. Where ever C was in the house, The Tall Boy was apparently there too. But never when we left the house. Never at the park or the grocery store. Only at home, I'd even see him waving to an empty corner of the room or an empty chair every time we left.\n\nThen i started hearing things.\n\nWhispers when C was supposed to be asleep. At first i thought he was talking in his sleep, but when i pressed my ear to the door I swear i heard two voices. C's high-pitched chatter, and then something lower, raspier. I would tell myself it was just the house settling or weird sound carrying in from outside. \n\nThen the breathing started.\n\nI'd be working in my office and I'd hear it. Slow, deliberate breaths, like someone breathing right behind me. I'd spin around. Nothing. It would happen in the kitchen while I was making dinner, I'd feel like someone was behind me and I'd feel breath on the back of my neck but nothing would be there when i turned around. It would happen in the hallway, when I was folding laundry. Always when I was alone.\n\nDoor started opening on their own. I'd close C's door at night and an hour later it would be wide open. Trying to convince myself it was nothing, I'd blame it on the old house, drafts, bad hinges on the doors that sort of thing. \n\nBut then C's room started getting cold.\n\nNot just cool, freezing. Even with the heat on. even in the middle of the day. i bought a small space heater, it didn't help. I had to put extra blankets on his bed and he would sleep in a hoodie. When i asked him if he was okay, he would just nod and say. \"The Tall Boy doesn't like it when it's warm\" \n\nThat's when his behavior started to change.\n\nHe got quiet. Stopped playing with his toys. He would just sit on his bed and stare at the corner and have full conversations with nothing. When I tried to join him, he'd get quiet and look at me like I had interrupted something important.  \n\n\nHe stopped eating. Or barely ate. He would just push his food around and say he wasn't hungry. But I'd catch him whispering to the empty chair next to him. Once, I swear I heard him say. \"No I can't. Daddy will get mad.\"\n\nI tried talking to him. Asked if the tall boy was being nice to him.\n\nC looked at me with big terrified eyes and said. \"I cant make him go away.\"\n\n\"What do you mean buddy?\" I asked him \n\n\"He wont go away.\" He whispered. \"I asked him to, but he said no.\"\n\nI told him imaginary friends aren't real. That he could just stop playing with him if he didn't want to anymore.\n\nC shook his head. \"He's not imaginary, he's real.\"\n\n I didn't know what to do. I thought about therapy, but what was i supposed to say? My kid has an imaginary friend that scares him? They would just tell me that this is a phase.\n\nThen, three days ago, C said something that  made me feel like I got punched me in the gut.\n\nWe were sitting on the couch watching cartoons, when he looked up at me and said. \"The tall boy said that mama was listening to the yellow song when she died.\"\n\nMy heart stopped\n\nMy wife was listening to Coldplay's \"Yellow\" when the drunk driver crossed the median. i know this because the song was still playing when the paramedics arrived. i never told anyone that detail. It's too painful I cant even hear that song anymore without thinking of her. There is no way C could have known that.\n\n\"C, how do you know that?\"\n\n\"The Tall Boy told me.\" he said. \"He says he was there.\"\n\nI wanted to scream. I wanted to grab him and shake him and demand to know how he KNEW that, but hes four and he looked so small and scared that i just held him and told him it was okay.\n\nBut its not okay.\n\nLast night, I heard footsteps in the hallway. Heavy, slow. i grabbed my gun from my side table and went out to check, C's door was open. I hid the gun behind my back and looked. C was sitting up in his bed staring at the dooreay.\n\n\"C?\"\n\n\"Hes here.\" C whispered \n\n\"Who's here?\"\n\n\"The Tall Boy.\"\n\nI slowly turned on the light hands shaking and then. Nothing. But C kept staring at the empty doorway, eyes wide.\n\n\"C, no one is here.\" \n\n\"Yes, there is.\" He said and started to cry. \"Hes always here.\"\n\nI brought him to my bed. He clung to me and cried himself to sleep.\n\nAnd this morning he said it. The thing that made me come here. come to reddit hoping someone can help me. \n\n\"The Tall Boy says he can take me to see mama.\"\n\nI asked him what he meant.\n\n\"He says if i go with him, i can see her again.\" C said. his voice flat, emotionless. \"He says she misses me.\"\n\nI'm writing this while C is at preschool. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should keep him home. I don't know if leaving the house even matters because this thing, whatever it is, seems tied to C not just the house.\n\nI'm scared that whatever The Tall Boy is, he's trying to take my son from me.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? What do I do? I can't loose him too. I can't.\n\n  \nplease if anyone has any advice, I need it.",

    "content": "I stepped off the tour bus and smelled the sea. The laughter of other passengers mixed with the cool breeze as I looked at the cruise ship towering over the dock. The excursion to the historic center had been perfect - local food, souvenirs, and dozens of photos, mostly of street cats. I was looking forward to the dinner on board, during which the ship was going to leave the port and begin a seven-day journey across the Atlantic towards the Caribbean. \n\r\nAfter I changed clothes and freshened up in my cabin, I headed to the main dining room. An announcement was made that the departure is delayed by about 10 minutes due to a pair of passengers being late. Oh well, the second time during the cruise that this has happened. I walked past slightly annoyed looking passengers and reached the dining room. It was a beautiful restaurant, stretching across the width of the ship and towering three decks high. It was decorated with white panels, completed with blue decorations on the tables and the chandeliers. Most passengers were already seated, while I was led to a small table for two in the back half of the hall. I couldn’t see out of any windows, but I wasn’t bothered by it because the food was very good. The other people were talking, laughing and enjoying their vacation.\n\r\n I finished the main course and was looking forward to my desert when I first noticed a couple sitting next to a window. The window was slightly dirty and had round corners, but what caught my attention was that they were crying. They didn’t look particularly sad, but there were tears streaming down their face. Without talking, they stood up simultaneously and left. Soon after, I heard shouting and loud noises outside the dining hall, but I didn’t think much of it and finished my dessert. \n\nI did not see the couple afterwards and headed for a small library lounge on one of the lower decks. On my way, I saw multiple crew members speaking quietly to each other while looking slightly nervous. After I sat down with my book, a crime novel from the 30s, I felt a slight sense of dread. I was sure it came from an overall feeling of unease coming from nearby crew members. After I noticed two of them talking, I started walking slowly in their general direction, pretending to look at the bookshelves. “They were brought to the cooling room on deck 3!”, I heard one of them say, followed by “I heard it was a mess! I am glad we were not there.” They then walked away, leaving me wondering what they were talking about. I wasn’t in the mood for my book anymore and headed upwards towards the open decks to catch some fresh air.\n\r\n I walked up the stairs, deck by deck, thinking about the two crew members. What kind of mess were they talking about? Why the cooling room? Just as I reached the top of the stairs, heading for the door leading to the upper deck, a young woman opened the door an came back inside. Or should I say, she just walked straight through the door without even lifting her hand, her Body just walked against the doors and pushed them open while walking slowly forward, like an unstoppable object. She looked straight ahead, not noticing anyone around her, but I immediately saw the tears. Not small ones, but a stream of tears running down her face. She did not even try to brush them away, just kept walking towards the stairs while looking forward. She slowly walked past me. I thought she was going back to her cabin, but she suddenly stopped in the middle of the stairway. \n\r\nShe slowly turned around with a smile, not a happy smile, but one you would give a crying child, a smile filled with compassion and pity. Suddenly, she bowed down and slammed her head forwards with an enormous force against the edge of a stair. Blood covered the stairs, and the sound of her skull splitting open echoed from the steel walls of the stairwell. I ran. I should have alerted a crew member or tried to administer first aid, but the feeling of unease was so big that I immediately ran outside on the open deck, but what I saw there, made me stop in an instant. About five passengers were outside, ten more were lying on the ground covered in blood. The five passengers all smiled with tears running down their face. One of them had a thin, broken steel rod in his hands, but before I could see what he had planned to do with it, I screamed and ran back inside, past the woman on the floor and straight into my cabin. \n\r\nI slammed the door shut and sat down, burying my face in my hands and sobbing. I examined my cabin, everything was clean and tidy. I wish I had a balcony or even a window, but I just stared against the wall. The slow movement of the ship was soothing, and I calmed down a bit. I sat on the ground for what feels like hours until I gathered the courage to peek outside the cabin again. \n\r\nI opened the door and looked down the hallway. It was quiet. The handrail on the side of the hallway had red stains on one spot, which I quickly looked away from. I moved towards the lifeboat deck to look for a crewmember. I headed up one deck, and just before the door leading to the lifeboats, I stopped. Letters, written in dried blood, covered the glass window of the door. “Don’t look down”, was all it said.\n\r\nI hesitated and refrained from pushing the door open. I turned around and saw a woman looking at me from a few meters away. I immediately looked at her eyes, and thankfully, there were no tears, just a frightened look. I immediately felt that her gaze also went straight to my eyes to check for tears. “Did you look?”, she yelled at me. I told her that I didn’t. After coming closer, I asked her if she knew what happened. “Passengers all across the ship have started to cry and hurt themselves! I don’t know what comes over them. I first noticed when I was chatting with a guy in the main atrium, when he suddenly looked out of the window and started crying almost like someone told him his family died. But he did not look like he was sad, he looked like he is sad for someone else. Overwhelmed by compassion. He then… he went and…” she started sobbing, but she did not have to continue. We both knew what happened to everyone that looked. \n\r\nAfter she introduced herself as „Sarah“, We decided to move further to the front of the ship in search of crewmembers who might be able to contact emergency services. It was already strange that no one showed up, we were still close enough to shore for helicopters or the coast guard to reach us. We tried to use our smartphones, but there was no signal. The ships wifi, advertised by the cruise company for being one of the fastest on the sea, had vanished. As we were moving forward, passengers with tears streaming down their faces walked inside from the lifeboat deck, but we never looked at them for long. \n\r\nJust before reaching the front of the ship, we saw a panicked crewmember walking towards the lifeboats. He saw us and gestured us to come. Even though the crying passengers were never paying attention to us, he was whispering: “They looked! All of the offices on the bridge, they looked!”. The feeling of unease intensified. If there is no one on the bridge anymore, we cannot contact the outside or turn around. The crewmember, who introduced himself as Jim, told us he is going to try and lower a lifeboat to escape while wearing a blindfold.\n\r\nWith a nod of approval, we prepared to go out on the lifeboat deck, tying a ripped sleeve storing our heads. Jim went first and pushed the door open. Cold air hit our faces like a thousand needles. We slowly moved forward and then to the left. After about 7 meters we reached a lifeboat crane. Jim pulled a lever, and the lifeboat began to ascent from the top of our heads towards the deck level so that passengers could enter. Just before it reached the floor, a part of the crane arm descending from the ceiling hit my head and ripped my blindfold from my eyes. \r\nThe impact threw me to the ground and left me disoriented. I heard the others scream something to me, but I felt dizzy and only heard their voices as a faint rumbling. I opened my eyes.\n\r\nI saw the waves below me. A beautiful sight, with the moonlight reflecting in the waves. First I saw nothing, then I noticed motion beneath the waves. I thought the motion came from sharks or dolphins judging by the size, but after my eyes adjusted to the dark, I realised. \r\nHuman bodies, moving with the ship. One of the bodies reached its hand towards the hull and started climbing, somehow having a grip on the perfectly flat surface of the ship. The body seemed long drowned but climbed upwards with a wide smiling mouth. \n\nPoor thing, I thought. It must be so cold and hungry. I felt pity for it, as if I found a dying animal on the road. Tears started streaming down my face. I could feel that it was so hungry, starved for years. If only I could give it something to eat. The tears kept coming. It reached the top and smiled at me. If only I had food on me. Maybe I could give it something of mine? It needs my body more than me. It looks so weak and desperate for food. Smiling so friendly. The sharp edge of the railing caught my attention. If only I could give it something to eat. I was standing in front of the railing, slowly raising my head. I wanted to crack my head open to give the creature food. It filled me with joy knowing that it would finally be able to eat something. Just as my neck muscles prepared to slam down, a hand tried to grab the back of my shirt. It did not bother me, I was concentrated on the railing. \n\nSuddenly, the hand grabbed me and violently pulled me back, it was Sarah, pulling me into the lifeboat. The smile on the creature vanished, and it opened its mouth wide to reveal many rows of sharp teeth. It’s gaze was suddenly filled with unfathomable anger. It leapt forward, but the lifeboat already lowered. It felt like an eternity to reach the waterline, but as soon as we touched down, I stopped crying. Confused and scared, we sailed towards the coast while the ship slowly disappeared behind the horizon.",

    "content": "I quit my job as an electrician yesterday. Being an apprentice was miserable: the pay sucked and I had no free time between the job site and night classes. I had plenty of legitimate reasons to give it up, but no one believed me when I told them the truth about why I left. My coworkers laughed at me, and my boss was just upset that I didn’t put in a two weeks notice. When I told my girlfriend about what had happened and begged her to move out of the state with me, she called me a liar and a coward. I went to the police and told them everything I know, but they wouldn’t hear it either. None of them realize that they’re in danger. I know that he’s going to come for me, but no one is safe: not even you. Don’t say that I didn’t warn you.\n\nI never wanted to be an electrician, but my girlfriend insisted that I couldn’t stay at my dead end restaurant job forever. I had no college degree and no marketable skills beyond serving tables, so I went with her suggestion: the trades. Being an electrician didn’t seem so bad, it seemed less messy than other blue collar work. I interviewed with the union, got accepted, and started my apprenticeship.\n\nI was assigned to a master electrician named Gary. He’s a scrawny old bald guy, probably around seventy years old, but more energetic than anyone else I know. I would end every day feeling absolutely beat from trying to catch up with him on the job site. I had no idea how a guy his age could move so quickly at the time, but after everything that’s happened I have some disturbing ideas about why that might be.\n\nGary loved to tell me stories. I didn’t really care to hear them, but I was willing to listen to appease the old geezer. He had worked in every state in the country at one point or another, and he had a story about each one of them. The strangest of them all was the one that he told about the state we lived in, Louisiana. I can still remember the first time he told it to me, it made my blood run cold.\n\n“There used to be a job that I would do here, every year, right at the beginning of November. Wherever I was in the country, I’d drive back here to make sure it got done. You ever hear about the blue flash near Lake Catherine, down south?”\n\nI told him that I’d never heard of the blue flash, but I knew where Lake Catherine was.\n\n“That was about fifteen years ago now. People don’t like to talk about it much. There was this family that moved into an old house down by the lake. The Browns. They were good folk, didn’t cause any trouble. But they had a problem with their cellar. They thought it was electrical, but it wasn’t.”\n\nHe paused. He must have sensed that I was only half paying attention. I asked him what the problem was, to show him that I had mostly been listening.\n\n“It was something I can’t explain. The blue flash. It would happen every year at the beginning of November. Had been happening for forty years by the time the Browns moved in. I first saw it when I was an apprentice, like you. The man I was working under was called to investigate it, and I was there with him. The family that lived there way before the Browns called him in to take a look at some wires in the cellar. It was the beginning of November, and the blue flash came. Thank God I was in the other room. You ever weld?”\n\nI told him that I’d never welded.\n\n“Ah, well, it was bright like an arc flash. Damn near blinded me. And the noise! Sounded like an atom bomb going off in my ears. Damn near made me hard of hearing, ha! It was bright, and loud, for just a second or two, and then it was gone. No more blue flash. But then I looked in the room. No more electrician neither.”\n\nI asked him what happened to the guy.\n\n“Dead. Burnt up in an instant. The smell was something else. Putrid and smoky. The family called the police. Imagine me trying to explain what happened to ‘em, ha! After the poor soul was removed, I came back and asked the family if I could take another look at the wires. Wanted to see what killed him. But I couldn’t find anything, there was not a thing wrong with the electric down there. Nothing!”\n\nI asked him what this had to do with the Browns.\n\n“Oh, the Browns, right. So for the forty years after the first time I saw the blue flash, I would come back at the same time every year and check the wires. The same day the blue flash would come. I kept my distance, of course, like the first time. Then I’d check the wires, to see what the problem was. Never was a problem. Never found anything wrong with those wires in forty years, least nothing that could cause that. It wasn’t an electrical problem. It was spiritual.”\n\nI was a little confused. I asked how he knew that the blue flash would return after the first time.\n\n“I guess it was just my intuition. Three different families moved in and out of that house, meanwhile. I was checking up on things for free at first, but when locals started to talk about the blue flash I turned it into a sales pitch. I would watch the flash come, keep anyone from getting too close, check the wires for good measure, accept my payment, and leave until the next year.”\n\nI asked what this had to do with the Browns again.\n\n“Oh, the Browns, the Browns, that’s right. So the Browns had this daughter, Jessica. And she’s always playing around in the cellar. For the first time in forty years, I’m running late to check on the blue flash. I hadn’t met the Browns yet but had heard that a new family had moved in who would need to be sold on my services. Surprise surprise, I get a call asking for an electrician from the Browns on my way to their place. So I show up and explain myself. Poor Jessica was blinded in one eye from the blue flash the night before. I look at the wires again. Always the same thing: nothing. The Browns press me for information, and I tell them that it ain’t electrical. It’s spiritual. I tell them about the poor man who died there forty years before. They laugh at me, they think it’s all a joke. Wasn’t no joke. And they found out. Oh, they found out.”\n\nI was getting pretty invested now. I asked what happened to them.\n\n“I heard about most of this secondhand. I wasn’t there. But people talked. They don’t anymore I suppose, but they did when it happened. Jessica saw a ghost in the cellar. Ghost of the man who was killed by the flash, I reckon. Jessica keeps ending up in the cellar, sleepwalking. Doesn’t remember going down, but she keeps waking up there. Parents get freaked out. They try to block it off, but she keeps getting in. Eventually, her father buys brick and just walls off the cellar completely. No way in or out. I don’t hear about all this until I show up for my annual checkup. When I arrive, the house is nothing but rubble. The flash came early. Mid-October. Right after it got walled off. Didn’t like being held in I suppose. Whole family dead. Presumably.”\n\nHe paused again for dramatic effect. I practically begged him for more information.\n\n“You want to know the worst part? Are you sure?”\n\nI did, badly, and I told him so.\n\n“There was hardly nothing left of the house but the cellar. They found Jessica’s mother, father, and brother in the walls down there. Twisted up like wires in the drywall.”\n\nI laughed. He frowned. It told him that it was a good joke, he got me good. He wasn’t amused.\n\n“It wasn’t no joke, son. Imagine the human body rolled up like a wire, as thin as you could possibly get. Then imagine it even thinner and tighter. They was hung in the walls like that. Some say that when the police found them there, they were still breathing. That’s not possible, of course. Being twisted up and squished like that would kill you. You couldn’t survive it. But still, that’s what some folks say.”\n\nI was skeptical, of course. I still thought that it might be a joke, but if it was, his poker face was impeccable. I asked him how that could even happen to someone’s body.\n\n“No idea. Must have been the flash. Or the ghost! Like I said, it’s a spiritual problem that was going on there. There’s no earthly explanation for it.”\n\nI realized that he hadn’t told me what happened to Jessica, so I asked him why she wasn’t in the walls with the rest of her family.\n\n“No one ever saw her again. Disappeared. Into the ether. The blue flash doesn’t come in that cellar no more neither. Folks said it seems like whatever was in that cellar go out that night. Hard to argue with ‘em.”\n\nThat was the end of the story. It stuck with me for a while, I just couldn’t get it out of my head. I asked some people who lived around Lake Catherine if they remembered anything about the Browns. They told me that there had been a family named the Browns who had lived there and that they had been killed in an explosion, but they didn’t know anything about a blue flash. When I asked about the family being twisted into wires, they laughed the same way I had. I guess someone had heard about the tragedy when it first happened and based one of those cheesy chain emails from back in the day around it. All the stuff about the blue flash and the family being twisted into wires was just made up, they told me. When I mentioned that Gary had told me about the story, they faintly remembered that there was an electrician that would come around every once in a while. Their impression was that he heard about the chain email and turned the story into his own since he had worked in the area.\n\nI felt a little better after all that. Gary was just a habitual liar, and not even an original storyteller. He told me the story a couple more times after that, and I just nodded along and acted like I was still interested. Really, all I could focus on were the contradictions and inconsistencies. The story didn’t even really make sense, and I began to feel embarrassed at having ever been frightened by it.\n\nHe tried to tell the story to me a fourth time, and by then I had had enough. I didn’t like that he had tricked me at the beginning, and I didn’t like for him to believe that he was still tricking me. I stopped him short while he was getting into it and told him what I knew: the whole thing was a farce, and the locals told me so.\n\n“You believe ‘em huh? You’re not going to believe the man who was actually there, who actually saw these things? You want proof?”\n\nI told him that there couldn’t be any proof, because it had never happened. He smiled.\n\n“Let me show you something, kid.”\n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. With great care he slid an old and yellowed Polaroid out of the fold. He held it up to me, but I could only see the back of the photograph.\n\n“Are you sure you want to see it, son? The proof you want?”\n\nI told him that’s what I wanted. He flipped the Polaroid around, and I saw the image. Immediately I regretted my decision.\n\nThe photo looked like it had been taken in a dark basement. I could make out a large piece of machinery on the floor and what appeared to be a family photo on the wall. That same wall had a large hole in it, and there was something you could just barely see inside the wall. I didn’t want to admit what I was seeing, but it looked like what Gary had described in the story: a person, twisted up into the shape of a wire.\n\nI shoved Gary’s hand away from me to get that picture out of my sight. He laughed.\n\n“What? You don’t like it, son? I thought that’s what you wanted!”\n\nI asked him who took the photo and how he had it.\n\n“I took it, of course. No one believes the story, so I have this. Can’t deny this.”\n\nI told him that it could be fake, the lighting was so dark that I couldn’t really tell what I was looking at.\n\n“Then why are you so scared?”\n\nI walked away, angry. He was probably just tricking me again, I thought. Why was I so scared? I kicked myself for falling for it.\n\nMonths went by and he didn’t bring up the blue flash or the Browns again. I started to forget about it. Two days ago, he invited me to get a drink with him. I didn’t have any night classes to go to, so I obliged. I wasn’t exactly dying to hang out with the old man more than I already did, but I didn’t really want to go home either.\n\nWe got to the bar and he started putting them away like it was some kind of race. I was on my second beer and he had already moved on from beer to whiskey. He was babbling on and on about all of his different stories and they started to blend together into one big stream-of-consciousness lie. After about an hour and a half, he was absolutely hammered. I had to walk him to the bathroom and keep him steady while he threw up into the toilet, but it didn’t help matters.\n\nHe wiped the vomit from his lips and asked me to walk him home. I had never been there before, but according to him it was just a half mile down the road. We got there eventually, but we had to make multiple pit stops so he could throw up. I wondered how often he did this sort of thing.\n\nWhen we got to the house, he spent what felt like an hour going through his pockets until he finally found his keys. We went inside and I helped him lie down on the couch in his living room. He asked for a blanket and a bowl to throw up in. When he had those things, he asked me to sit down next to him for a little while.\n\n“I want — I want to talk about the blue flash,” he slurred out.\n\nI told him that I didn’t want to talk about that anymore.\n\n“No, I — I apologize. I didn’t tell you the, the, the truth. I told you the made up version. The made up version that I, that I tell people.”\n\nI told him that it was okay, I wasn’t really interested in hearing any more about it. He ignored me.\n\n“No, kid, I — the blue flash, it really happened. I saw it, and it spoke to me. Something was in it. Spirit. Spiritual. I saw it in that, in that, uh, in that cellar. And it said things to me. Didn’t like it. I didn’t like it at first but I — I wanted to hear more. It told me it would come back every, come back every year. Same time. Same time, same place. Every year. So I did, and it would tell me more. Told me how I could make my own. My own blue flash. Told me about how I could, I could make my own and what it could do for me. Could lure people. Mess with their brains. Make them think things. And then I could — I could—”\n\nHe trailed off and his eyes closed. He was still mumbling under his breath, but I could only hear a few words here or there. “Live forever,” “squeeze”, “machine”, and “poor girl,” were what I could make out. I sat next to him for another minute, then decided that it was about time for me to leave. I stood up and took a few steps toward the door, which caused him to regain a bit of consciousness.\n\n“Where you going? You’re not going to the basement are you?” he stammered, with concern in his voice.\n\nI told him that I was just going to leave.\n\n“Don’t go in the basement, son. I don’t like, I don’t, I don’t like people snooping around. Snooping around my house. Not your business.”\n\nHe got quiet again and I wondered why he was so concerned about me going to the basement. I just stood there and stared at him for a while to make sure that he was asleep. There was no more mumbling, just snoring, so I figured that the coast was clear. I walked around with the lightest steps I could muster, looking for the basement door, and found it. I checked again to make sure that he was still snoring, then descended the steps.\n\nI fished around for a light switch when I got to the bottom. I found one, but flipping it did nothing. How ironic, the master electrician couldn’t be bothered to fix the wiring in his own basement. My phone’s flashlight would have to do. It cut through the pitch darkness and revealed a familiar scene. There was a large machine in the middle of the room, and a family photo on the wall closest to me. This was where he had staged that photo.\n\nThe machine was strange, I had never seen anything like it. I searched it for any sort of brand logo but found nothing, it appeared to be custom built. It appeared to be operated by a hand crank, which would cause multiple large metal rolling pins to turn. What its purpose was I couldn’t tell at the time, although now I feel it should have been obvious. I examined the pins a little closer, and saw that they were stained with dark splotches all over. Could it have been blood?\n\nI continued to look over the machine, being as silent as I could, and I realized that I could hear a faint repetitive noise coming from behind me. It sounded almost like breathing. Had Gary followed me down here, being as quiet as I was? I turned slowly to face the wall, expecting to see him staring at me, but there was no one there. I could still hear the breathing, coming from directly in front of me. It couldn’t be, but it sounded like it was coming from the wall. I got closer, and the sound got louder. It was gaspy, desperate breathing, like someone who just can’t seem to ever get enough oxygen. I pressed my ear against the wall, and I could hear it as clear as day. Could an animal have gotten stuck in there? I listened intently, and after a few moments I heard something that I will hear in my nightmares for the rest of my life. First a groan, a warped but human sounding groan, and then a single whispered word that sounded like it had been forced through their throat with every fiber of their being:\n\n“Help.”\n\nI turned to run up the stairs and out of that place as fast as I could. I got to the first step, looked up, and saw Gary in the doorway. He was slumped over, holding himself up by leaning on the door frame, but I could see fury in his eyes despite his drunkenness.\n\n“I told you… I told you not to go down there, kid. Why? Why did you, why would you go down there? You’re gonna make me, you’re gonna make me…”\n\nI cut him off to tell him how sorry I was. I pleaded with him, saying that it was just an honest mistake. I told him that I wouldn’t tell anyone about what I saw, and that I didn’t really see anything anyway. The rage in his face only increased.\n\n“No, no, no, no, no. You wanted to see. Even after, after I told you not to. Well you saw. Did you hear her? Did you hear them? Them, there’s more than one. Many of ‘em, many, from all over. One, at least, at least one, from every state. Ha! They stay breathing for a while after, after the squeezing, and the twisting. For a long while, even after I get the life essence out of em. Blue flash told me, told me how to do it. Extract it and store it. You want to see that too? The, the blue flash? I can show you…”\n\nI realized that begging wasn’t going to work, so all that was left was to try to run up the steps and push past him. As I climbed, he pushed his hands out in front of him and started chanting something loudly. I couldn’t make out any of that he said, my heart was pounding in my ears and I don’t think anything he said was English. Right as I reached the top of the stairs, there was a momentary burst of blinding light that came from behind me. I’m certain that if I had been looking toward it, I would have lost my vision. My back felt like it was on fire. I tackled Gary and we both went tumbling to the ground. He tried to get on top of me and hold me to the floor, but I could just barely wriggle my way out of his unnaturally strong grip. I ran out the door and back to the bar, screaming, his chanting still ringing in my ears.\n\nI got in my car and drove home. I stayed up all night, watching out the window, as my girlfriend yelled at me for being out so late. You know what happened the next morning: I quit my job and I told my girlfriend, my coworkers, and my boss what happened. Nobody took me seriously. I can’t blame them. It’s a ridiculous story, and technically I didn’t really see anything. What I heard in the wall could have been my mind playing tricks on me. Maybe the machine was stained with oil and not blood. The bright light in the basement could have been anything. It could all have been an extremely elaborate prank that Gary was pulling on me. I can’t prove anything, but I know what it was.\n\nI’m packing up and leaving Louisiana for Pennsylvania. I’ve got family there. I’m not safe anywhere, but at least I’ll have put some distance between me and him. He’s going to come for me eventually, I can feel it. I don’t expect you to believe this story either, but I’m begging you, just be careful if you need to hire an electrician. He’s going to be around for a while, and he could be anywhere. Don’t end up in Gary’s walls.",

    "content": "After moving in I immediately started sleeping with a large chef’s knife on my bedside table because it isn’t the best neighborhood. After about a week my wife woke me up in the middle of the night extremely alarmed and told me she thought someone was downstairs because she kept hearing someone. I leapt out of bed grabbed the knife and charged down the steps as fast and loud as I could in an attempt to frighten the intruder and also because I was forcing myself to be brave. I didn’t find anything after thoroughly searching every room, closet, and the entire basement. Time goes by and we forget about that night after anointing the house with holy water. And then one early morning I wake up to go use the bathroom, when I leave I can hear my wife is in my step-daughter’s room waking her up and telling her it’s time for her to get in the shower. I go back to bed and lay down next to my wife who never left the bed. I don’t think anything of it because I was half-asleep. Later that day my wife & step-daughter were shocked while talking about it and that’s when I realized that it’s almost as if my wife astral projected or something. We anoint the house again and nothing major happens for a while. Until my wife hears heavy work boots marching up our stairs straight to our bedroom door… and then nothing. A week after that I awoke around 3 am and saw a tall figure standing in our doorway. I screamed! My wife woke up and I pointed and the figure was gone. Life goes on until tonight, when my wife told me she used the bathroom in the middle of the night, and she heard me walk from the basement door through the kitchen, living room, and hallway, stop right outside the bathroom and hears my voice start talking to our dog. But when she goes back to bed I’m already dead asleep. There have been other incidents, but these are the main events. Has anyone here ever experienced an entity mimicking them or their loved ones? What should we do?",

    "content": "A few months ago, my friends and I went to a hill station for three days. On the second morning, one of my friends woke me up at 4 a.m. We wanted to catch the sunrise from a viewpoint deep in the forest. Our third friend refused to get up, so it ended up being just the two of us.\n\nIt was freezing, and we held our hoodies close as we started walking. The path was marked but manless, forest was thick, there were tall trees almost falling on the path on both sides, and this strange silence that made the sound of every rustle of the leaves beneath our feet echo. We followed the signboards, thinking we were close to the viewpoint, but every time we checked the map, it somehow seemed to move further away.\n\nThen I felt like something was watching us from woods but nothing we could see. When we checked the map again, we realised the route actually passed right next to a Hindu crematorium and a Parsi graveyard hidden behind the trees. That’s when the atmosphere changed for us completely. Some parts of the road had weak lights, but most of it was swallowed by darkness. We thought about turning back, but being that deep in already, we were scared of getting lost.\n\nThat’s when four dogs appeared out of nowhere. At first, we panicked, thinking they’d attack us. But they didn’t, they just started walking with us, two in front and two behind, as if guarding us. They would stop when we stopped and bark whenever they heard something in the forest.\n\nAfter a while, the road just… ended. Beyond it was pure blackness, like stepping into nothing. The dogs started barking wildly at that emptiness. There was nothing visible, but their reaction was so fierce, it was enough to tell us not to go any further. That’s when we decided to turn back.\n\nThe same four dogs walked with us the whole way back, right till we reached the town centre. The streets were empty, not a single person around. We waited there, and the dogs waited with us, sitting quietly beside us like they knew we weren’t safe yet. Finally, around 6 a.m., a shop opened. We bought some biscuits and fed the dogs.\n\nJust then, a man on horseback came by. He said he could escort us to the viewpoint, there was finally some light now. We turned around to look at the dogs… but they were gone. Vanished completely.\n\nWhen I told my mom about it after coming home, she got really upset. She said that at night, there are things- dark, sinister things, that roam freely. She looked at me and asked, “What if one of you had gotten possessed? You were only two. What would you have done?”\n\nThat question still gives me chills. I don’t know what really happened back then but I do know this: those dogs weren’t just dogs.\n\nI managed to take this picture on our way back to the town centre, you can see one of the dogs in it:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/royalbluesword/s/nZCWSa8mT6",

Now this is where it gets odd. We were watching an episode when Alexa turned off the lights suddenly and starting playing Kendrick Lamar’s tv off song but only the section where it goes “turn the tv off, turn the tv off” repeatedly. My girlfriend and I are both shocked because now it’s dark and we have Alexa on 100% volume saying turn the tv off and we’re still trying to understand what’s going on. I turned on the lights by flicking the switch. Alexa then decided to play Flashing Lights by Kanye West. Mind you I do have flashing lights on my Spotify list but I do not have tv off on any of my playlists nor do I really like the song so I’m not sure why she would play that. \n\n\nTo this day we are still unsure what happened because it only that one time and never again.",

    "content": "To begin this I work in a hospital in the psych unit and we are on the opposite side of the actual hospital and in our own section. I work in the adult unit and we have two sides, a side for more mild patients and another side separated by double locked doors that has two windows for more intensive patients. On this particular night we shut the mild side down because we discharged our last patient and only had the intensive side open.\n\nI kept going back and forth to the milder side because most of our paper work and things we need are on that side. This was starting to freak me out because it’s such a big area and it felt so eerie being empty and I always get weird vibes in the unit at night. As i’m making my way back towards the double doors I looked in window and saw a reflection of someone behind me, at first I thought it was a patient on the other side of the doors but it was an unfamiliar face. It looked like an elderly person and as I looked harder they were smiling ear to ear, which freaked me the hell out. I stared for a little while because I thought my mind was just playing tricks on me because it had been a long stressful night, but sure enough it was definitely someone smiling at me. I freaked out, unlocked the doors to the other side and refused to go out there again alone. \n\nI know what I saw but I seriously can not believe it. I do believe in spirits and energies but I have never seen something like this in my life. And there is no possible was it was a patient on the other side of the doors because when I went back there everyone was in their rooms. There have been stories I’ve heard from coworkers about certain rooms being haunted but I sort of brushed it off because if I truly believed it I would never go back to work lol I don’t know I just needed to share this with someone because the image of whoever or whatever was behind me is burned into my brain.",

    "content": "hi guys, i want to start this off my saying that i’ve never posted on here before so im sorry if my reddit etiquette is wrong & im sorry for my poor story telling.\n\n i’m going to share my experience about this house my family and i lived in from 2019-recently. i’ve always seen things here and there, but i don’t know if i believe in ghosts or whatever. im not scared of anything i’ve ever come across since i tend to just ignore it all, as if it never happened. i find that it makes it much easier for me to deal with. \n\nmy point in sharing these experiences is to just hear what other people have to say about it. that’s it, that’s all. at most, i just want people to listen to these things that have happened to me. — feel free to ask me any questions \n\n—————————\n\nin 2019, my family and i moved into this house in the downtown area of our small city in saskatchewan, which is 30 mins away from the us border. the house is situated between a parking lot and a duplex to the right of it and another parking lot and a small house made of stone to the left of us. this stone house is the first house built in the city and it still stands to this day. for some reason, i always figured that all these paranormal events just lead back to this house 30 steps away from us since a parking lot and a picket fence were the only things between us. however, i digress.\n\n1st instance -\nlate 2019 (before covid shut everything down) - i recall it was night time and i was at home with my mother who was watching tv and my father, who was also in the living room. we have these bells on the door knob of our front door which we intended to train our dog to use each time he needed to go potty. however, this never worked and we just left it on the door. moreover, this bell ended up being a way of letting us know if someone came home. as i was sitting in the living room with my mother, i heard the bells. i expected it to be my sister since she was the only one who wasn’t home. i was just excited to see her so i got up and went to our room. she wasn’t there. but i distinctly remembered hearing the bells on the door so i went to look at the entrance ‘cause maybe she had not come in yet. instead, i found the door to the basement agape and moving as if the wind had blown it to move slowly. the front door was not open and my sister was not there. in denial, i asked my mom if my sister was home because i SWEAR i heard the bells ringing and she said she heard the bells and she figured it was me, but my sister was not due to be back for an hour.\n\ninstance 2 - \nin 2021, my sister in law moved in with us after giving birth to my lovely nephew. it was only my sister in law, my nephew, and me in the house. i was in my room when i heard my sister’s footsteps (she drags her feet so i knew this was her). i then heard her playing with my nephew and i heard him laughing. after 30 minutes i got up to go see what my sister was up to since she had not come into our room yet. when i stepped out, i noticed that my sister was not home. i sat in the living room and my sister in law joined me shortly after. a few moments of silence filled the room. suddenly, she asks me if i “heard that too.” she was talking about my sister’s footsteps and i told her how i heard her son laughing. he had been asleep at the time, and he still was when we were talking.\n\n3rd instance - \nit was my freshman year of high school, 2021. at this time, masks were still being recommended but not mandatory. i chose to wear it just cause i was an insecure teenage girl that thought everything was embarrassing and this lead me to never take my mask off, even to eat (im mentioning this because i want to note all of the things that could have contributed to how i experienced these events). nonetheless, i came home from school hungry and tired. i was sitting at our dinner table, home alone. when in my periphery i see a white figure run from the farthest corner to my right to another corner in which i could not see. i gave myself little to no time to think and i got up to see if what i saw was real. i followed it to where i believed it ran to and obviously nothing was there. mind u, this house was very small so if someone was trying to hide from u, no they couldn’t. & neither could u.\n\n4th instance - \nin early 2022, and my entire family had covid with me being the exception. so instead of them being isolated, i was sent to the basement to quarantine. the basement is unfinished and one of the walls are made of the same stone infrastructure that the house to the right of us was made of. there was a stuffy room in the basement and had a walk in closet that was filled with belongings of the home owner like furniture and boxes of clothes. \ni was sleeping on a mattress on the ground. as i laid there, my head was facing the closet as there was no door to separate the rooms. i turned the lights off in the actual room but i kept tne light on in the closet. in my direct view, there was a chair sitting under the closet light. i recall almost feeling paralyzed and staring at one of the chair legs. for what felt like minutes but were only a few seconds in reality, i watched a pale hand grasp onto the chair leg. after those 3 seconds, the hand let go and i went straight to sleep.\n \n- i want to mention that my sister and i eventually stopped sharing a room in 2022 because my dad built me a room in the living room area if that makes sense. in the same place where i saw that thing run to. & where the room in the basement is directly under. \n\n5th instance - \nabout a year ago, i had my friend over at that house. we were in the basement when i started telling her about all the scary things i’ve experienced in that house just to try and give her a little scare. i ran up the stairs and she followed behind me. she had heard my stories before but i found it amusing because she tends to get scared easily (i love her, i promise). i was getting all dramatic and saying all these things out loud which i never usually do cause i don’t want whatever could’ve been in there to know that i was aware of it’s “existence”. i said, something that was insulting to the appearance of the ghost as a joke (stupid, i know) and a piece of glass tupperware “flew” off our table and broke right beside where my little sister was standing. i ran to see if she was hurt but i recall that same\nglass tupperware being placed on the highest point of the table (fruit holder stand thing) not too long before it broke. mind you, my little sister is a toddler. last year, she was even tinier than she is now and i know damn well she would not have been able to reach the tupperware. thankfully, she wasn’t hurt, but i definitely did not speak like that ever again.\n\nshortly after (may 2025), we ended up moving into a our own house and nothing had happened since. every time\ni bring this up to my aunt and uncle who believe in ghosts, they always tell me it was because the basement barely had any light coming through since most of the windows were blocked. i don’t get scared easily (i’ve been chronically watching anything and everything horror since i was 10) so i was able to hang out in the basement, even with the lights off. but i would never be able to stay long cause i always felt like i was being watched. anyways, im getting tired so sorry if this was shit. someone pls lmk what u think this whole thing was. i swear on my life that this all actually happened to me.",

    "content": "This story is about my dad mostly but, as much as he \"saw the devil\" so did my grandma and my dad's childhood friend. \n\nMy dad was born on a Polish post communism countryside, people back then were very poor and most of the families were abusive.\nMy dad's story begins with the words that he used to go mushroom collecting since he was 3 y.o because he knew the forest around his house so well. He never got lost not once he always knew where he was and how to get back home or how to reach the closest road. I believe him because when I was a kid he used to tell me stories about his own childhood that mostly took place in that exact forest.\nAlthough when I was around 13 or so, my dad my auntie and my dad's friend were seating outside our home, they were drinking beer I was just there to listen.\nAs it always goes with alcohol on the table random stories began to pour out of them all, when my dad and my aunt started talking about how some places in the world are just paranormal and there is no explanation to it whatsoever. My dad said that he \"saw the devil\" once in that forest and so did my grandma.. I got confused so I asked them what devil? Did they mean a ghost? A weird animal? \nMy dad explained to me that the phrase \"seeing the devil\" from the countryside they are from is a moment.. an event not a clear paranormal activity.\n\nWhen my dad was around 17 or 18 and started seeing my mom, he was coming from a small city(where my mom lived) back to his countryside home town in the late evening, in the middle of the stormy forest my dad's bike broke and so he got off of it, started walking thru the path in the rain. The rain was pouring like crazy, at one point so my dad just lowered his head to protect himself from the rain, when he lifted his head back again after a few steps, he suddenly didn't knew where he was, he lost the path that he just walked on. He got supper confused. This whole time he didn't knew where he was, he heard a car a few times and tried to find the road, but couldn't, he was soaking wet, it was getting dark as hell, and he was lost in the forest he knew his whole life. He only managed to find the path again after it stopped raining, the rain stopped at the snap of a finger. When he got home my grandma started laughing at him so did my auntie, my dad was confused and so they started talking about it, he said that it wasn't funny because he got lost in the forest for 40 minutes in heavy rain, my grandma looked at the clock, she got her knowing look on her face meaning that something was going on, so did my auntie. They told him that the heavy rain lasted at last 15 minutes, my dad was shocked. Something that took 15 minutes outside the forest, lasted for him 40 minutes of madness in that forest.\n\nThen my dad told me that my grandmother that knew this forest as good if not better then my dad got lost once too, this time on a sunny and cold autumn evening, while collecting mushrooms, not knowing where she was and she felt like the time has passed much much faster then it actually did. Lost in the place you know better then the back of your hand. The same happened to me dad's friend. And apparently a lot more people from that countryside experience that too. This isn't much but I've been to that forest many times too. And at one point there is something chilling about this place.. something felt off I felt watched sometime. Those stories gives me chills to this day.",

    "content": "Hello, throwaway account because I’m too embarrassed to post this on my main, but I’m hoping someone here can give me advice on what I should do about this. \n\nAnyway, these past few months have been hell for me and it’s hard for me to talk about. As stupid as it is, my hands are literally shaking as I write this, haha. I live with my parents and we’ve all been experiencing things that at this point, we can only describe as paranormal. \n\nIt all started with the lights, which I at first assumed was an issue with the bulbs. They were flickering and turning off and on, but we have since then changed them and it still hasn’t stopped. It’s mainly in the bathroom that it happens.\n\nThen our cats started seeing things. They’ll stare into the distance and sometimes hiss at nothing in particular, which never really happened before all this started. \n\nAnd then we began hearing things. The first thing I heard was a growl. It was the middle of the night and came from the hallway. It was deep and it scared the shit out of me. Our cats aren’t capable of making noises like that, believe me, and I admit that we did have a few windows open, but it wasn’t a windy night. My parents often hear me calling/screaming for them when I’m not, and my step-dad has heard a man say hello. Apparently it was very clear, but he was the only one who heard it and he was really shaken after, so I believe him wholeheartedly. I’ve also heard music and knocking, but it mainly happens at night.\n\nBoth my step-dad and I have been touched. He once felt a hand running down his back when he was in the kitchen and at first he thought it was my mum, but she was standing too far away to do that. I’ve felt things grab me, sort of like a hand on my arm, and sometimes it’ll feel like someone is leaning on me, or like they have their arms around me, which usually happens when I’m in my room. It’s really heavy and it makes me feel scared and sick. It doesn’t help that a lot of the time, it feels like there’s something on my back or pressing down on my shoulders.\n\nWe’ve both been scratched as well. I don't know where he was scratched because I only recently heard about it and he didn't say, but my stomach was. He bled but I didn't.\n\nA few nights ago I was going to get water and I felt like something was watching me. So, I looked down the end of the hallway and I swear to God I saw something peaking out from behind the coat rack. It was dark, but I could easily make it out. It was a tall, shadow-like figure that just stared at me. Genuinely, my blood went cold and I thought I was going to throw up.\n\nI’ve also seen things move. For example, my albums fell off the shelf above my desk out of absolutely nowhere. The window wasn’t open, and they fell in the opposite direction of what they were leaning. I don’t know if that can be caused by something else, though. The hand towel rack (it’s one of those ring ones) in our bathroom moved as well, swinging from side to side. I was in the shower when it started, and no one else had been in to move it.\n\nI’ve been having a lot of mood swings, as well. It could be attributed to the fact that I’ve been stressed recently, but with everything that is happening I don’t know. And since all of this has started I’ve been having nightmares, too.\n\nThere’s probably more as well, but my head is a mess right now and I can’t think of much else. I also don’t know how we would have invited anything in. All I know is that I’m terrified because it feels like I’m being watched constantly and things keep happening. I tried to do the whole ‘this is my house, get out’ thing, but since then it’s only gotten worse. We’ve also had the house blessed twice over the years, and we have blessed crosses and bibles in the house so I don’t know why that isn’t helping. \n\nWhat can I do? Please tell me what my options are. I feel like I can’t breathe in this house. We’ve never had the intent of inviting anything into our home, and although we have had a few odd experiences before (most likely deceased family members), we’ve never experienced anything like this. It sucks even more for me because I’m dealing with the brunt of it. I hope all of this makes sense because I really need help.",

    "content": "I recently moved into a trailer on my sisters property and one night I’m laying in bed in a twilight state about to fall asleep until suddenly I hear footsteps in my trailer. I knew nothing was there because my German Shepherd/Wolf mix dog who was lying next to me would have definitely alerted me.\nThen the November air grew hot and clammy and I felt almost paralyzed.\nNext thing I hear is a knock at the door and my sisters voice telling me our mom was here and to come greet her. Mind you, my mom was in another state and had no plans to visit. I don’t respond. I just lay there contemplating the situation.\nThen out of nowhere on the other side of the trailer where my bed is, I see out the window, a tall slender man thing walking past the window above my bed.\nMy dog reared up and viciously barked at him. This is unusual because he likes the element of surprise so he can attack.\nThe guy seemed alarmed and uttered the word “geez!” and disappeared.\nI’m wondering if it was the same creature who knocked on my door or if it was something else coming to, I guess, protect me? I’ve had weird encounters in the past where someone or something magically appeared to scare off whatever was threatening me to begin with.\nThoughts? It’s been driving me crazy…",

But I also can’t discredit her, as I witnessed my own encounters just never seen one. I mentioned in my original post about how my stepdad & I both heard screaming coming from my room. I heard it inside my room behind me one day & he heard it from my room in the middle of the night when I wasn’t home. That’s the creepiest thing I experienced with it & while I was very scared, I eventually became more accepting of it.\n\nIdk why I didn’t mention this in the first post but   I figured you guys would be interested in hearing this & I’d love to hear if anyone else had a similar experience!\n\nI only ever did this once because it actually felt very weird & I did not sleep well after this lol but after about a year living there I decided to try & communicate with whatever was in the house. I had this nightlight that I kept in the wall at all times & never once had it do any of these things, which is what kind of shocked me the most. I asked whatever it was questions, asking it to brighten the light, dim the light & flicker it to answer me. It’s been so long that I don’t remember what I asked it but I’ll never forget watching the light get manipulated like that & I still don’t know how to actually feel about that.",

    "content": "I'm F17, I live with my 3 brothers, parents and 2 dogs. Since I was about 7 years old I've seen some things that I can't explain.\n\nAt around 7ish years old I had my first encounter (that I can clearly remember) I was closing my bedroom blinds before going to bed so it was dark outside. As I was about to close my blinds I saw a face in looking in. It wasn't human. It had a smile going up to each eyes, red textured skin and horns coming out the side of its head. Me being 7 year old and terrified I screamed, my parents ran in, I looked away for a second and it was gone. My parents told me I was probably seeing things but THAT looked so real to me.\n\nWhen I turned 8 I started seeing a shadowy human shaped figure follow me around, at school, in home, on walks. It wasn't always there but I would see it multiple times a day in the corner of my eyes, if I'd turn my head to look it would go away. This continued happening until I turned 13.\n\nAt 9 years old I got my first ever book shelf to put my LARGE stuffed animal collection on, on top of that shelf was an inspirational quote in a frame. This frame was no where near the edge of the shelf, my window and door was closed and my fan was off. Out of nowhere the quote went flying off my shelf to the other side of my room. Again I screamed and froze in fear, my parents bolted in and said a gust of wind must've blown in down.\n\nWhen I turned 13 all of it stopped until I turned 16. At 16 I started hearing knocks on walls, doors started closing, my dogs started growling at what looks to be walls, posters have been falling and creepiest of all my radio started randomly going off and the volume somehow grows louder. At this time I started coping with it by saying I'm haunted by a ghost I named \"bob\" so now whenever somethings weird happens like my radio being turned on I say \"bob, can you please stop turning the radio on\". \n\nLast night something really freaked me out, I felt some sort of presence and the next thing I know something whispered in my ear \"Bucket Anthony\". I've NEVER in my entire life encountered anything like this. Could that be it's name? We found a very old shoe under our house years ago that looked like it was from around the 1960s, we always joked it was haunted but now I'm not sure if that joke has become reality.\n\nToday while I was watching a movie in my room my parents yelled out to me \"___ is that you knocking??\" I replied with \"no! I think it's ke____(brother)\". They investigated and my brother wasn't knocking. My parents came down to \"someones playing tricks\". No one else heard the knocking, only they did.\n\nDo you think there's something else living with us?\n\nEdit: to add that same shadowy figure was seen during a sleep paralysis, that's the only sleep paralysis I've had and I've never had it again. The figure was standing at the end of my bed staring at me. I couldn't do anything about it, I couldn't move, speak or wake up. This was at 12 years old.",

    "content": "I remember my first encounter of sleep paralysis. My mom and I went to stay at a friends house overnight and I remember laying in bed next to her actually facing towards her and feeling completely paralyzed, but my eyes were wide open and I could see my mom soundly asleep I decided to blink and the next thing I know a strange scary figure came across her face. I tried to scream I tried to shout, but nothing worked nothing helped eventually I shut my eyes really tight and begged for myself to move and that’s how I end up moving. I try to explain what happened to my mother the next day and she had no idea what I was talking about. It was the first time I ever discovered what sleep paralysis was.  years went by and I didn’t have it again until I went to college that I could’ve correlated to just being under stress I remember sleeping in my dorm and sleeping on my side. I would just feel intense pressure. I would constantly feel like a person was either crawling over my shoulder or just resting on my side. It was odd. I always felt like my roommate was in the room and often times I would jump out of bed and she wasn’t there. I would even ask her, Hey did you come in the room a minute ago and she would look at me all confused like I was crazy I started having a lot of episodes during college eventually it went away. But my most recent encounter really scared me I’ve been living alone in my apartment for 4 to 5 years with no issues until recently. I have no idea what triggered it. I have no idea what cause it but all I remember was resting in bed. It was the middle of the day, I always leave my curtains open till the sun can shine in, when the sun hit its peak, I began to feel my body become intensely heavy. I couldn’t move, but I definitely felt that someone was at the edge of the bed near my feet. I really couldn’t see what it was, but I just knew it wasn’t good. Then the next thing I know I felt fingers on my stomach. It was almost like a spider climbing over my stomach and caressing my stomach resting on it and I just felt an intense pressure wave over my body. My eyes were completely open the entire time watching the sun beam in my face, I couldn’t do anything about it. I felt so helpless. Some see a connection to the alternative universe, but what do you guys think?",

    "content": "Scotland’s Highlands are known for their wild beauty, deep mist-covered glens, and dark, towering mountains. But beyond the breathtaking views, there’s something more hidden in the folds of the land — the eerie, sorrowful cries of spirits who still haunt the ancient valleys. These are the legends of the **Banshee**, the **Washerwoman of Fate (Bean Nighe)**, and the **Weeper of the Glens (Caoineag)** — figures whose wailing cries have been said to foreshadow death, disaster, and tragedy.\n\n# The Banshee — The Sorrowful Spirit of the Irish and Scottish Highlands\n\nThe Banshee, derived from the Old Irish *bean-sídhe*, meaning \"woman of the fairy mound\" or \"fairy woman,\" is perhaps one of the most iconic figures in Celtic folklore. Her mournful cry was said to be a harbinger of death, echoing through the night before someone passed away. The Banshee's origins can be traced back to Ireland, but as the Celts moved into Scotland, her story traveled with them, evolving in the misty Highlands.\n\nWhile the Banshee’s sorrowful wail is a sign of death, it’s more than just a sound — it represents the deep emotional connection to family and clan, marking a time of loss and inevitable fate. In the shifting tides of history, as Christianity began to spread through Scotland and Ireland, the Banshee's role grew to symbolize not only mourning but nature's own sorrow. She became a personification of grief, a figure that wasn’t just about the forewarning of death, but a reflection of nature’s unrelenting force.\n\nToday, many believe that the Banshee’s cries can still be heard in certain remote Highland areas — echoing across the land, a reminder of the enduring ties between the living and the dead.\n\n# Bean Nighe — The Washerwoman of Fate\n\nIn the heart of Scotland's fog-laden Highlands, **Bean Nighe** — the Washerwoman of Fate — is said to appear beside quiet streams, washing the bloodstained garments of the dead. Often linked to women who died during childbirth or in tragic circumstances, she is cursed to continue washing garments soaked with the blood of the fated, marking the lives of those about to meet their end.\n\nHer appearance varies — some tales depict her as a small, sorrowful woman, hunched over the stream, scrubbing the dead’s clothing. Others describe her as a terrifying creature with strange, unnatural features such as long breasts or webbed feet. But regardless of her form, the purpose of Bean Nighe remains constant: she is a figure of fate, an omen that foretells death.\n\nThe legend of Bean Nighe says that if you happen upon her and catch her unawares, she may reveal the fate of someone you love. But if she sees you first, then your own death is certain. This eerie legend underscores the inevitability of death and the deeply ingrained belief in fate that resonates throughout the Highlands.\n\n# Caoineag — The Weeper of the Glens\n\nWhile Bean Nighe is associated with the washing of the dead, **Caoineag** — the Weeper of the Glens — represents the sound of sorrow itself. Caoineag's presence is never seen but always heard — her mournful cry drifting through the Highlands, often along the shores of lochs or in the shadows of the hills.\n\nIn folklore, Caoineag is linked to particular Highland clans, and her cries are thought to foretell calamities like war, massacres, or other tragic events. The most famous example of Caoineag's wail came before the **Glencoe Massacre of 1692**, when locals heard the sound of a woman crying in the days leading up to the horrific slaughter. Her cry, it was believed, was a warning, a signal that tragedy was imminent.\n\nCaoineag’s wail is not only an omen of death but a deeper, more unsettling symbol of nature’s grief for mankind’s actions. She is a representation of the land itself mourning the cruelty and violence carried out by humans.\n\n# The Curse of Fearn Abbey\n\nThe eerie presence of these spirits is not just confined to ancient tales. In **Fearn Abbey** (Easter Ross), a tragic event in 1742 seems to tie these spirits to historical events. During a Sunday service, the roof of the abbey suddenly collapsed, killing more than thirty worshippers. In the days leading up to the disaster, locals reported hearing the cry of a woman near Loch Slin. Some believed it was the wailing of Bean Nighe or Caoineag, signaling the impending disaster.\n\nA young girl from Cromarty claimed to have seen a tall woman by the loch, washing bloodstained clothes. No one believed her until the tragic accident occurred, and the loch was forever dubbed “The Lake of Bloody Clothes.” This event is one of the clearest historical markers of the weeping spirits of Scotland — a chilling reminder that these ancient legends are rooted in real, devastating events.\n\n# The Banshee Labyrinth and Modern Hauntings\n\nAs time marches on, the ancient spirits of Scotland haven’t disappeared. They’ve adapted, finding new life in modern Scotland. One famous example is the **Banshee Labyrinth Pub** in Edinburgh, where workers reported hearing weeping during renovations — just before they received news of a loved one’s death. This eerie connection has made the pub one of the most haunted places in Scotland.\n\nOther paranormal phenomena still persist in the Highlands. On **Benbecula Island**, a sound engineer once recorded faint sobbing in the wind while filming a documentary. The voice was distinctly female, and despite no one being present, it carried on the wind, its source impossible to pinpoint.\n\n# The Enduring Legend of the Weeping Highlands\n\nThe tales of Banshee, Bean Nighe, and Caoineag are not just stories of the past; they are living, breathing aspects of Scottish culture. These spirits represent our connection to the land, to death, and to the tragic events that shape history.\n\nThey are more than just ghosts; they are symbols of the past, reminders that the land remembers, and the spirits never truly leave. Whether they are the harbingers of doom or the embodiment of nature’s grief, the cries of these spirits continue to echo across the misty Highlands.\n\nSo, the next time you’re walking through Scotland’s misty glens or by the quiet shores of a loch, stop for a moment. Listen. The wind may just be carrying the weeping cries of the past, still mourning the tragedies that have shaped this beautiful land.",

    "content": "When I moved into my boyfriend’s apartment everything started to fall apart, literally. Right before I was supposed to move in, a pipe between the kitchen and the bathroom cracked and flooded the apartment below us. We lived for about seven months with an actual hole in the wall and a kitchen that could not be used at all.\n\nSince the beginning I have been feeling really uneasy, especially in the bathroom and in the hallway leading to it. Sometimes I feel like someone is watching me there. Once I even felt as if someone pulled on my pants while I was about to undress. It scared me so much.\n\nThe bedroom is no better. It turned out, that water from the roof gutter leaks directly onto the wall. I often feel like someone is walking there, or just standing and watching.\n\nLately things have become even weirder. The bathroom light is often on, even though nobody has been inside. I keep hearing tapping sounds near the metal trash can. Sometimes, when I sit on the toilet scrolling through TikTok, I pause the video to wash my hands, and while my phone is out of reach it starts playing again on its own, or even scrolls to the next video. The bathroom also gets extremely cold for no reason, even though it is a small room, the heating is on, and the window is closed.\n\nThere are also strange sounds in the kitchen and living room. Sometimes I hear the TV playing, but when I walk in, it is completely off. Sometimes I hear the sound of glasses clinking as if someone had flicked them with their fingers. Things fall or make noise for no reason, yet when I check, everything is in its place.\n\nI have also been having disturbing dreams. In one dream I saw ghosts walking in a line toward the wall in our bedroom. Then they turned around and walked back in the direction of the bathroom. I was lying in bed and watching myself sleep, standing behind me. In another dream I was floating in the air, paralyzed in a strange twisted position, with one hand stretched out, and a smoky hand appeared from nowhere and pulled my fingers.\n\nMy partner and I are honestly scared to go to the bathroom at night. We usually leave the door open and the light on in the hallway when we have to use it.\n\nI would Like to attach a photo of the hallway, at the entrance to the bathroom. This is the spot where I feel the worst, even when I just walk by. But it is not allowed in this sub.\n\nAny Advice on this case, despite moving Places?\n\nPS: The building itself is quite old, around 70 or 80 years old.",

    "content": "So this is unexplained to this day, always will be but, my 2nd and last ghost story(currently). Never know when one will make it’s presence known again!\nWhen I was around 13 years old, me and one of my friends like to used to sneak around people’s property in the middle of the night. It was about stealing or being destructive, we just enjoyed trying to traverse the neighborhood undetected. Which we always were always successful! We didn’t do anything overly creepy like look in windows. Would just hop fences, investigate nothing and on to the next one. One night we had a third friend with us and he was not a fan of this activity. There was one particular backyard we liked a lot, they had weird grass. It was extra fluffy or something IDK. So the three of us go to basically trespass, in this yard again and about 25 yards into entering the backyard, friend #3 backs out and walks back to the front of the property. We continue on without him making our rounds. The backyard had a row of apple trees all the way against the back fence, so we would usually walk through them a bit and then exit on the other side. We reach the apple trees, do whatever and start heading out of the backyard on the opposite side we entered from. As we start Walking out, we look left and see a figure, it looked almost completely white but our first thought was the friend who backed out decided to join us. I remember saying “ what the F*** are you doing?” The figure turned towards us a bit and we no longer thought it was our friend. We immediately began running out of the backyard. As soon as we reached a certain point we could see our friend sitting on a rock  at the edge of the neighbors property. I still would have bet it was him maybe trying to scare us but he would have had to also run to reach that point before we did and he was not out of breath, breathing heavy, gloating over his successful scare or anything. No idea what we saw but we saw something. Year’s later I used to think, maybe that weird extra thick and fluffy grass, was a sign of something worse. Bodies buried or something.",

    "content": "I lived in the same house my whole childhood, matter of fact, I even stayed in the same room until I was 15. Well, in this room there was some sort of energy I didn't feel (maybe cause I grew up in it), but all my cousins (who were all 15+ years older) hated sleeping in my room when they stayed the night.\n\nOne night when I was about 7 or 8 I was playing hide n seek in the dark with my siblings and cousins; I ran through my dad's closet that was connected to the bathroom and out to the hallway. However, when I ran through the bathroom I saw a little girl around my age standing over the bathtub. I though it was nothing till a year later my brother described seeing a little girl in the same bathroom. FYI, the bathroom was right across the hall from my room.\n\nAnother instance was when my dad kept telling me he could hear me in the middle of the night walking to the kitchen, telling me I had to stop staying up late on school nights, but I wasn't. He said he could here what sounded like those silica gel balls from the packets loose on the floor, bouncing down the hall to his room (my room and his were next to each other). He also said he'd hear the dinning room chairs move, but IDK if that one is real. The dinning room was also right next to my room.\n\nLastly, and the most terrifying was when I was 8 years old and I was up late on a summer night watching *Phineas and Ferb*. I had one of those basketball games that you see in the arcades, but a cheaper version. In the hoop there was a thin plastic lever to track the scores. When the ball would go through the hoop and hit the lever it made a LOUD springing sound like a diving board. I was laying in bed with the basketball game behind my head, when suddenly I heard the springing sound. I jumped up and turned around to see the ball rolling down. I was so freaked out I immediately turned off my tv and slept with my dad. And I'm not even joking when I say this, but it was around 3am and I remember cause I couldn't believe it. I was so terrified that I could remember every detail so vividly.\n\nSince that day I left toys out for her when I would go to school and talk to her even if I didn't know if she was there. Maybe I shouldn't have done that, but I'm fine and it made me feel better about sharing a room with a ghost. My dad still lives there and we still joke about the ghost till this day.",

    "content": "Those of us in Alaska are far to familiar with summer’s sunshine, the days that have little to no night, but once you reach the arctic circle it’s a whole other pot of chili entirely.\n\nFor when the sun refuses to go down beyond the horizon, that is when you start to fear the dark.\n\nOld Inuit tales tell us of the Tornit, how they were here when the first Inuits made shore fall. They lived in peace for a time but the Tornit vanished one day after in a fit of rage an Inuit boy killed a Tornit.\n\nThat story however is not mine to tell, if you want that one I would suggest you go talk to an Inuit elder. It’s their story and they’ll tell it best.\n\nWhat I can tell you though is my own experience with the Tornit or as we local nonnative call them the Alaskan Bushmen.\n\nIt was mid summer on the longest day of the year, I was out camping well more like hunting out in the arctic. In a near by village I was asked to hunt down a bear that raided storage shed, got away with quite a bit of food that one.\n\nAny ways I was mushing through the tundra following the tracks of the bear, at first I thought it was a tree due to how tall it was. It seemed to keep pace with me. But always at a distance like an uncanny silhouette. \n\nI needed to keep a steady pace as to not tire out the team, so I tried to keep an eye on it. But when I blinked it was gone again as fast as it appeared. \n\nThe wind then began to pick up not a warm wind from the south but a chinook wind that puts ice in your veins and snow in your soul. That’s when I saw them again. Tall shadows far out in front of me, bring the dogs in. I stared at them. Though I couldn’t see their features I knew they were watching me, no that’s not quite right they were studying me. Like if I was worth anything.\n\nThe feeling made goose bumps rise all over my body like my instincts were telling me to run, so I did. Turning the team around I ran. The dogs didn’t need me to say anything, they booked it. I grabbed onto the sled for dear life as they dashed. There were more of them now shadows silhouettes all around us, then in a blink all that was left was a laughing wind.",

    "content": "For new readers to my story, I live in a community that was built over a 1800s graveyard east of Houston Texas. The grave markers removed but the graves weren't. People found them while building pools and the incident was taken all the way to the supreme court. There is even an Unsolved Mysteries episode about the hauntings and stories told about my community\n\nAnyways, it's been almost 4 months since my last update, and I thought that the house has been very quiet. I went over 2 months without any activity that I couldn't explain away. But I realized about a month ago that I am not the one seeing what's going on. So, before I begin and the pitch forks come out on me. My wife and I do NOT discuss or show what we have seen or experienced in the house in front of our kids. Both kids are young (2 and 4) and are on the spectrum (stage 2 and 3). and they are non-verbal. We don't know what they see or understand. We don't want them to be scared, confused, or influenced by us. My oldest, my daughter, comprehends alot and is starting to communicate more and more. Mainly in 2-word sentences. \n\n  \nOne night, we had just gotten home from a family outing, and I was taking my daughter to take a bath. We usually have the kids take a bath in the Master Bathroom as there is a large garden tub that can fit both children comfortably. It was late in the evening, and the house was luminated by outside streetlights that show through the open windows. So, there was a was enough light for me and my daughter to be able to without turning on lights to see. I open the door to the Master Bath, and my daughter immediately looks startled and takes a step back. I look in the direction she's looking which is a pitch-dark closet. But I don't see anything. She smiles still looking into the dark and doesn't say or sign anything. I turned on the lights, and I still didn't see anything. After I got her in the bath, I pulled my wife to the side and told her what happened. She didn't say anything to me but went to our daughter and started to question her. \n\nWife: \"Did you see anyone in the bathroom?\" \n\nDaughter: \"yeah\" in an excited tone. \n\nWife: \"Was is a man or a lady?\" \n\nDaughter: \"Lady\" \n\nNow keep in mind, our daughter is 4. No means yes, yes means no and up is down. However, what was said next was what confirmed she has been seeing more than what we know of. \n\nWife: Does this lady have a name?\n\nDaughter: ABBY!!!!\n\nFor those who don't know, we have gotten this name several times. I have even posted an EVP that we caught in my son's room that we believe that says \"Abby\" in a long breath. After this my wife and I looked at each other and didn't ask any more questions but it proved to us, that our kids are experiencing things just like we are. Our daughter never acts scared in the house and as I've said in almost every one of my posts, whatever is there, doesn't seem like it's out to get us or to scare us. More like just letting us know it's there. \n\nAs always as more happens or now if we learn more, I will update",

I could go fishing when I wanted and we were far enough from anchorage that the air was pure and clean which was exactly what the doctor ordered.\n\nBut you aren’t here to hear me rant about how good the place was you want to hear about the creature that stalks it’s now abandoned streets.\n\nThe locals call the creature the Nantinaq, bigger than Bigfoot with the temperament of a feral grizzly and the brains enough to move through the peninsula without a sound.\n\nThe sightings started small at first a shadow here and a shadow there. Then small pets started going missing. That is when the town started a bear watch thinking it was black bears being were they shouldn’t.\n\nIt wasn’t long after, that people started getting attacked, and then the disappearances started. Some of the locals claim people just up and left the town, others say their houses where torn apart like someone or something hated the interiors.\n\nWhen I saw it its was a cool morning and I had been working all night. I smelled it first, the smell of wet fur caked in mud and something metallic.\n\nIt seemed to float out of the fog, its face just human enough to be uncanny framed in a mane of wild fur that was as dark in the moonlight as the very night itself. \n\nIt glided towards me and I ran! I couldn’t hear it but I knew it was in pursuit like how you can tell you’re be stalked while hunting the chill down your spine, the thickness of the air. I ran until sunrise which thankfully wasn’t far off.\n\nAs the light rose and burned away the fog I got a clear look of it before it fanished, it had found an easier meal….",

I have this stuffed animal duck that I have had since I was 4, and at the time I slept with him every night (still do tbh), but since we still had loads of boxes I had lost him and didn't want to go to bed. My mom eventually just told me if she or my oldest sister finds him she will bring me him. So I went to bed without a problem and I woke up around 3:30AM to a woman standing next to my bed by my head, I slept by the door so I could get up for school easier, so I saw the woman with the hallway light. She was tall with long hair, she looked motherly but that's all I really remember, otherwise she was just hard to see. She gave me my stuffed animal and told me \"here you go honey\" and tucked me back in. I remember saying thank you and falling back asleep. I woke up the next morning to go thank my mother for bringing me my stuffed animal, she was confused and told me it wasn't her, probably my sister. So I went to her and thanked her, and it wasn't her either. And sure, it could've been someone else in my family but my sister and mother were the only adult females at the time and they usually just called me by a nickname or my middle name. Nobody had ever called me honey. Sometimes, I still hear the word \"honey\" whispered before I go to bed and its always so clear, a few times ive felt someone rubbing my back, I sleep in my own room. But I haven't seen this woman since. Have I just been crazy? Oh, this house also used to be part of a church. The part where memorials were held and stuff. The house is 253 years old. Anyone know anything I probably should?",

Nothing ever felt weird about that house.\n\nWe were sitting on the couch, watching a movie, when I noticed movement on the staircase. I looked up, and there was someone slowly walking up the steps.\n\nIt looked like a middle aged man….old clothes and some kind of hat. I couldn’t tell if it was straw or one of those flat formal ones. Just… old.\n\nThe way he moved didn’t make sense. It wasn’t like a person….almost like he was floating through the air. My cousin saw it too. We both froze, completely locked in place. It couldn’t have lasted more than a few seconds, but it felt like forever.\n\nMy grandparents slept in separate rooms. My grandmother downstairs near the living room, and my grandfather upstairs. When we finally moved, we ran straight to her room and shook her awake, freaking out about what we saw.\n\nShe didn’t hesitate for a second. She got up and went upstairs. My grandfather was legally blind and always had his dog with him. We would’ve heard the dog if it had been him.\n\nShe asked him if he’d been downstairs. He said no. He hadn’t heard anything. The dog hadn’t moved.\n\nShe searched the entire upstairs. Every room. Every corner…..Nothing\n\nTo this day, I have no idea what we saw walking up those stairs.",

    "content": "Hello! since I posted a story about my Dogman encounter in BC years ago (I will include that story at the end), I was asked a couple of times to expand on my paranormal encounters so I decided I would put my full story together in order as best as I can remember. None of these stories are fictional or exaggerated. These are my paranormal experiences or weird moments in my life, so far.\n\n—The Beginning—\n\nMy paranormal experiences started when I was roughly six years old, my first experience was very unexpected since at this point in life I didn’t really know about the paranormal or spirits.\n\nOne evening, I was watching TV by myself in the living room while my parents were napping. As I was watching, I suddenly felt a chill on the back of my neck followed by what felt like someone pushing a firm single finger straight down into the top of my shoulder. As that happened simultaneously, I heard someone whisper “Hello” behind my right ear.  \n\nAt that, I sprinted into my parents room telling them I heard someone whisper in my ear and that someone was in the house. They brushed me off and didn’t check for me. To this day, I wonder if this event somehow opened me up to the years of events that followed.  \n\n—Closet Encounter—\n\nAfter this incident, unexplainable things started to happen in my house. My stepdad liked to scare me from time to time, and he would hide in my closet before bed and poke at my feet to scare me.  \n\nOne night before bed, I checked my closet and closed it, knowing nobody was in there. Not long after I laid down, I could hear the door to my closet sliding opening. When I looked at the dark crack in the closet, I saw red eyes staring back at me. I ran, flicked the lights on, and  opened the door, thinking my stepdad was in there trying to scare me again—but nobody was in there and those eyes were gone too.\n\n—The Eyes in the Bathroom Vent—\n\nAnother experience I would have frequently involved the bathroom. When I took a bath, I would always see the same red eyes from the closet in the vent above the bathtub, just watching me.\n\nIt made me extremely uncomfortable, and I spent most of my bath time throwing a wet cloth at the vent. Usually, whenever I hit it dead on the eyes would disappear... until the next time I had a bath, that is.\n\n—The First Apparition—\n\nOne night, my older brother and I were hanging out, playing games. He asked me to go upstairs to grab him a cup of ice cubes (he liked to eat them) as I was walking up the staircase, I looked up towards the railing that overlooked the downstairs. Standing there leaning onto the wooden railings was a figure dressed in a long, heavy-looking hooded robe. Its face was shrouded in blackness, and I couldn’t see any defining features.  \n\nI don’t know why, but I continued walking up the stairs but I noticed that as I moved, this entity stopped leaning on the railing and began mimicking my movements in reverse. Every step I took up, it would take one step backward toward the kitchen.  \n\nWhen I reached the top of the stairs, the figure had made it to the doorway of our kitchen, where it stood. It glanced in my direction and vanished right before my eyes. \n\n--The Second Apparition—\n\nI saw this figure one more time while I lived at this property.  \n\nI was upstairs on the computer, playing World of Warcraft, which had just recently been released. As I was playing, I started to hear cracking sounds, like someone cracking their knuckles. I thought I was alone in the house at the time, so it struck me as odd. I got up and opened the door to the hallway leading to the same staircase and kitchen area.  \n\nWhen I opened the door, the figure was standing at the end of the hall. It wasn’t looking at me though, but I could hear the cracking sound again, realizing that it was coming from this entity. I slammed the door shut and locked it. About ten seconds after shutting the door, I heard a strange sound that I can’t even describe. It was followed by what sounded like the door being pushed hard, like as if a big gust of wind had hit it.  \n\nTo this day, I have no idea who—or what—that was, why it was there, or if it was trying to connect with me. I also wonder if this entity might be the same one with the red eyes I had seen previously. Was it getting closer to me?  \n\n--The Babysitter—\n\nThis next part I was unsure about leaving in, but since I’m describing my weird upbringing, I might as well.  \n\nI’m not sure if this person contributed to the weirdness I experienced, but she definitely pushed my brother and me to seek answers on our own, as you’ll see here.  \n\nMy babysitter (I’m going to omit her name) was someone who had connections to our family. Her sister worked on our farm and had her own horses stabled there, so her mother often came along. After a while of her being around she ended up becoming our sitter.\n\nNot long after she started sitting for us, she told us that she was a “witch.” She showed us really old Polaroid photos of her and two other people performing some kind of ritual with symbols carved into a table they sat at. She also showed us things she could do, like moving objects around without being touched.\n\nFor a long time, I thought this was just a fun story and tricks, but one day, I went inside from playing in the garage and made my way upstairs, where she was preparing dinner. She was unaware I was nearby. I witnessed one of our knives on the counter slide about two feet across straight into her hands and she just continued cutting as if nothing abnormal had just happened. She never saw that I noticed, and I never brought it up, but what that sparked in me was curiosity and because of that, I started researching “black magic.”\n\nAfter looking around online with my brother, we stumbled onto some websites that gave directions on how to perform black magic rituals, and so we attempted it ourselves. We went outside, drew a pentagram with fallen leaves, placed a statue in the middle, and began to read off the ritual words we had written down. It was at this moment that our sitter looked outside, saw what we were doing, and ran out, screaming at us to stop. She started kicking the leaves everywhere and taking the statue we had placed. She scolded us, saying we had no idea what we were playing with and to never do something like that again. Not long after, she stopped sitting for us, and sadly, she passed away not too long after that.\n—\nWhile this part wasn’t necessarily paranormal, I think the context is needed to understand how my upbringing was and how these events may have created a domino effect for more to come. One thing was for sure, my sitter had an interest in the occult.\n\nMy last experience at this property was more tame but still creepy, I was getting ready for school in the morning and as I went to grab the hair comb it just flicked off the counter and hit the wall behind me, I know it didn’t just fall.\n\nNote:\nThis brings us to the end of the first house before we moved to rural BC near Lone Butte. I would like to note that these experiences so far are just the ones I could easily remember. They don’t include the noises I would hear, voices saying my name when nobody was home, shadows of people in my peripherals, and the feelings of being watched or sometimes touched.\n\n—The Move to Lone Butte—\nAt this point in my life, we had packed up and moved about 5 hours north to the outskirts of Lone Butte, BC—about a 20-minute drive from our place. The property we moved to sat on was roughly 100 acres of woodland. We were in the middle of nowhere, and our closest neighbors were a good distance away.\n\nAnyway, here are my main experiences at this house. I won’t include everything, as there are just too many experiences of footsteps, things moving by themselves around the house, people talking when alone, shadows when nobody was home… you get the point.\n\n—The Closet Slamming + Terrible Timing—\nMy first major experience at this house was with my brother (who is very skeptical) and my stepsister. We were watching The Grudge at the time, and all of a sudden the upstairs closet started violently slamming open and closed for well over a few minutes. This terrified all of us and we didn’t know what to do, so we just ran outside and waited for our parents to come back home I did endup going back inside to grab shoes since the gravel was hurting my feet. When I went inside, I poked my head around the corner towards the living room just as the scene in The Grudge played where it's a close-up of her eyeball rolling from the back of her head to stare at you. I always found the timing to be so perfect it’s almost comical, but at that time, it scared me to death and I did not want to go back inside at all.\n\n—The Schoolhouse & the woods—\nSo, quick context about the property I was unaware of until I moved away years later. The property we lived on in Lone butte was around 100 acres and was old native land, the property had 2 barns, one for the horses and one was storage/workshop but it wasn’t always just a barn for storage, it use to be a old school were the catholic priest would bring the native children and force them lessons about Christ, this place on the property was burnt down at one point then rebuilt. It even had the old desk and chairs stacked up in the corner of it. There’s been rumours I’ve heard of possible mass graves being tied to places and that these school houses were not particularly kind towards the native children.\n\nAnyways, my experiences with this schoolhouse along with my brother is that we’ve both seen the faces of kids in the glass and lights from the workshop would randomly turn on and off at all hours of the day or night. The woods at this property were just as spooky, we would find old leather belts tied up to trees, pickaxes, machetes, long and deep gouges ripped out of trees and prints of large animals around the forest. We also found what I think was a junk yard for old vintage cars, some have been there so long trees were growing through them.\n\n—The Dogman— (Repost)\n\nOne night I was in the hot tub on the deck outside just watching the woods, taking in the silence, it was winter time and we just recently had a snowfall that left around knee height deep of snow.\n\nIt was around 2-3am and out of nowhere this very large wolf, bigger than one I have ever seen by far came out of the woods. I remember its coat being a shimmering silver and its bright piercing green eyes. \n\nAs this wolf was walking along the fence of our paddocks it locked eyes with mine and we just kinda stared at each other as he walked past me, both alone in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. What happened next till this day instantly makes my spine shiver, as the wolf walked past he walked towards our barn with our horses in it. It became darker as it entered the barn but the other side of the barn still had a bright light illuminating the outside that I could see clearly. This wolf as it entered, half way through it went from the shape of a wolf to a very large, broad shouldered person. The horses didn’t make a single sound and this person that now stood roughly 7 feet tall walked down the rest of the hall and rounded the corner towards the open field but didn’t emerge from the other side, I never saw it again.\n\nMy brother had his own encounter with this same wolf I’m guessing, he told me that he woke up randomly one night from the feeling of being watched. He then looked out his window too see a very large wolf walking away from his window so I’m guessing it was watching him sleep.\n\n———- \n\nI’m going to end it off here, I do have more paranormal stories and some UFO stories but it’s more just subtle creepy experiences and this story is getting way too long lol. I wanted to highlight the major ones I felt may of contributed to these experiences happening to me growing up. \n\nIf you have any questions I’ll do my best to respond or if you have similar stories share the link or DM me, Im always interested in hearing others experiences. If you made it all the way through this thanks for reading!",

    "content": "Bunny Man\n\nThe Bunny Man, or rather persons in Bunny Suits, are Urban Legends believed to have hailed since the Civil War and the 1970s from two peculiar incidents related to threatening of a serviceman and a civilian subsequently throughout time.\n\nThe reported incidents both claim to have a person wearing White or Black/white suit with Bunny Ears, holding an Axe and threatening persons to maintain a distance.\n\nIn the first case, it's the US Air Force Academy Cadet Robert Bennet, when with his wife in a car, had been attempted by Bunny Man to leave the property in which his car was parked, smashing the rear window of the car with an Axe.\n\nThe second one goes as, when a security guard notices a person in a Bunny Suit standing on a porch and smashing one of the pillars of that. When he goes to check in on him, he smashes it harder and threatens the security guard to leave the premises.\n\n\nWhat does this say about the Bunny Man?\n\nEven though the motive or intention of the Bunny Man still remains as a mystery, it's mostly related to owning and occupation of a property. If it's an Urban Legend like the Ghost face where all upcoming individuals who are in such a mentality pretends to be the Legend, the threatening is primarily based on chasing away persons from a property - Bunny Man Bridge (Colchester Overpass - Fairfax Station, Virginia).\n\nAnd if the Bunny Man is an Urban Legend like Jason Voorhees, he may be related to a Vengeful Spirit. He, since he's called the Bunny 'Man', shall have something left regarding his property or it's that maybe he had wanted to own property in any way but hasn't had the chance to satisfy his intention or rather, the dream - but has somehow suffered a unfair departure from his body.\n\nTo know more,\n\nKindly contact through direct messaging for any amendments or clarifications.

    "content": "I'm a doctor that works in an ICU. We had a young patient in his early 20s who unfortunately was the victim of a drunk driving accident about a couple weeks prior, sustaining severe brain injuries, and to be honest was not having the best hospital course. \n\nThis morning the patient's parents burst in freaking out because they said someone had called them telling them their son had coded. We talked to all the nurses, doctors, students, and everyone else on the team and couldn't find anyone who had called the family that morning at all. Don't know if it was some horrible prank call or unfortunate misunderstanding but in the end the parents were able to see the patient in his bed in the same condition he had been in prior, critical but alive.\n\nI kid you not, not even 4 hours later, I get a call that the patient's oxygen levels are dropping. By the time I am at the bedside (about 20 seconds later), the patient is pulseless and we start to code the patient. Half an hour later, things are only getting worse an the code is called, the patient was officially dead. And all I could think about was that creepy call the parents got that morning. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the patient was in horrible shape to start, and didn't have any other visitors or anything so it's not like foul play was suspected. But it was absolutely one hell of a coincidence",

    "content": "i’ve never really talked about this story but after seeing some of your guys posts i decided to share a story. i am currently 15 years old so its been about 7 years since this happened since i was 8 years old at the time. this story started at a campsite in new jersey.\n\nit’s a pretty popular campsite it’s very safe and calming. so one summer when i was about 8, my family and some family friends decided to go camping. we were staying for about a week or 2 (i can’t really remember) and it was the third or fourth day. i was with 3 other kids, dylan (10), sophia (10), and maddie (14). We got bored after eating dinner. sophia and dylan brought walkie talkies so since there was 4 of us, and 2 walkie talkies and we were in a safe area, we decided to play hide and seek. we decided that we would split into teams, 2 people hiding together and 2 people seeking together. each team got one walkie talkie.\n\ni was hiding with dylan, we got a 5 minute head start to run around the huge campsite (i’m sure some of you have heard of it, it’s in cape may.) we had actually gotten pretty far, we were on this road and right by it there was just straight woodlands and there was a few houses there as well since some people buy vacation homes there. we were kinda just sitting in our spot on the side of the street for like 10 minutes. sophia and maddie came on the walkie talkie to ask for a hint, we gave a hint and after like 10 minutes they couldn’t find us so they gave up. we assumed they were probably close so we told them the street we were on and they said they would meet us there.\n\nhowever something weird happened right after they said they would meet us there. all of a sudden, through static we heard an unfamiliar voice of a southern sounding old man. he sounded to be in his 50s or 60s and he said “now i know where you live.” we obviously did not live there but it freaked me and dylan out. we asked sophia and maddie if they heard that but they said no. we decided to scratch the idea of them meeting us where we already were and we decided to meet at the lake, which is kind of in the middle of the campsite. dylan and i were still kinda shaken by the weird voice but we brushed it off as a glitch or something. as we were walking to the lake, we noticed a beat up red car circling around us a little too much. we ignored it and continued walking until the car slowed down. he pulled up right behind us and rolled down his window and when he spoke, we heard the same voice from before. he said “hey guys do you need a ride” we didn’t waste anymore time and we sprinted away.\n\nthe man in the car looked agitated from what i saw when i looked back, dylan said he saw him getting out of the car but i didnt see it so im not sure. we found sophia and maddie and tried to tell them what happened but they didn’t believe us. we walked back to the campsite and didn’t tell our parents anything about it and we continued our day. i still wonder who that man was and what he would’ve done if we stayed in that spot any longer. i also wonder how he got onto our private walkie talkie conversation. was this just a misunderstanding or was he actually trying to do something?",

    "content": "I live in the suburbs. I was at my local mall — it’s one of those open-air ones — and I stopped by the Barnes & Noble. I was sitting near the Starbucks inside when I noticed this woman sitting across from me, about ten feet away. She was reading a book.\n\nA few minutes later, she suddenly stood up and walked straight toward me. Right away, I could tell something was off about her. She was small, quiet, but there was this worried energy about her that made me uneasy. She asked if I was from the area. I said yeah. The whole time, I just had this strange feeling — something wasn’t right.\n\nThen, before walking away, she asked if I had any book recommendations. I said no, and she went back to her seat across from me. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something about her was wrong.\n\nFive minutes later, she came back. This time she had a book in her hands. She looked at me and asked how old I was. I told her, and when I asked her, she said she was 29. Then, out of nowhere, she opened her book and showed me pictures — photos of missing people taped inside. The images were unsettling. Creepy, even. She asked if I’d seen them.\n\nI instantly tried to steer the conversation away and soon after, I left. But I couldn’t stop thinking about her. She looked lost, maybe like she’d been kicked out of her home or something. I felt bad.\n\nAnd then today… I saw her again — sitting in the same spot at that Barnes & Noble.",

    "content": "I (23F) was on my way home from work (I work 3-11) and I got my low fuel light on my car. I just figured I would get gas at the gas station by my house so I just continued on my way. My car stalled out about a half mile from the gas station in a dark suburb because the light was out at the intersection. I put my hazards on and contacted AAA and they said they be there in about a half hour. Okay, whatever, I’ll just chill on my phone til they get here. \n\nA lady came out of her house and approached my car asking if I was alright. I explained my situation and she said she would stay by her window to make sure I was safe and that AAA shows up. I thanked her and she left. A couple people driving by pulled up and asked if I was good and drove off. \n\nAbout 10 minutes into waiting for AAA, a dark truck pulls up and stops in front of my car. The headlights turned off, but the car was still running, I could hear it. I immediately locked my doors and watched this hooded man approach me. I couldn’t see his face because of the broken streetlight and it was dark outside considering it was near midnight. He knocked on my window and I rolled it down just enough to be able to talk to him. \n\nHe asked if I was alright, and I told him I was, and he offered to let me sit in his car because “it was cold out, and my car stalled out.” I said I was fine and gestured to my phone saying that AAA was a couple minutes away (they were not, I still had about fifteen minutes of waiting) and that I’ll be on my way shortly. That didn’t deter him and he got closer to my window, and I could have sworn I heard him pull on my door handle to see if it was locked. I moved as far away from him as I could and then the lady from earlier came out and yelled at him. \n\nHearing her voice, he immediately left me alone, got in his truck and drove away. The lady came to me and said that he didn’t seem like he had the best intentions and she waited with me until AAA arrived. \n\nMy bf and my best friend (both 21M) think I was being dramatic and reading too much into it. I’m not sure what his intentions were, but I got such a bad vibe over it. I don’t really know what to think.",

He came up to me again and pointed at my sweatshirt pocket and said “you can keep that in your car, you know. You don’t need it in here”.\n\nWhat was in my pocket? Pepper spray. He was telling me to get rid of my pepper spray. I told him I didn’t feel like it and would be keeping it. \n\nAt this point, I was pretty eager to just get the fuck out, and might have just gotten in my car and pulled some laps around the block if not for the fact that the dryers don’t lock and I was paranoid about him looking through my stuff.

And my grandma asks \"what are you thinking about?\" i responded \"the dude i told you about\" (The guy dressed as an elf whom i didnt know was within earshot of me and right be hind me) to which my grandma looked up waved, I looked behind me. *holy shit what the hell? why did he sit behind me??* I thought.\n\nNote: my grandparents and i are sitting at a low table on the other side of a bar like thing an elf is up at the high table at the bar like thing and there is glass somewhat separating us. and I had my school uniform on at the time\n\nElf- \\*knocks on glass\\* (weird) \"hey whats ur name?\"\n\nMe- \\*doesn't talk but does an idk gesture cuz i don't want to talk to him\\*\n\nElf- \"oh sorry I'm santa, what do you want for christmas?\"\n\nMe- (thinks: *no ur dressed as an elf but thats not the point*) \\*does same gesture as before\\*\n\nElf- \"Do you even talk?\"\n\nMe- \\*Same gesture again\\*\n\nthis kind of continues on and i do eventually kinda talk but only one word responses, he's not getting my body language. but we leave and instead f going home which is across the way we went to a crowded bar (i tried to cover up as much of my uniform as possible and look as different as possible) and i told the waitress and I never saw him again but I am wondering if i will see him again the christmas. What stood out to me was the knocking on glass to get my attention and the not getting body language etc.\n\nSo, did i do too much?\n\nedit1: there were plenty of empty seats mind you",

    "content": "Not a super extreme story, but it still disgusts me every time I think about it cause it happened very recently. I was at the supermarket with my sister (she was somewhere else in the store), reading the ingredients on a soda when I suddenly noticed a man, probably in his 30s or older, standing way too close to me. It startled me because I hadn’t even noticed him walk up.\n\nHe smiled and said “hi,” and I said hi back, thinking he was just being polite after scaring me. I kept focusing on the label, but he stayed beside me pretending to read the same thing. When he realized I wasn’t reacting, he slowly walked away then came back and said “smile, smile” while laughing. I just looked confused and said, “I’m good, thank you.” He looked like a total creep it was very obvious! i really wish i was more rude to him.\n\nAll i could think of is that he probably thought i was a minor, cause i get told that i look like a teenager A LOT when i am actually 25. He thought that he could easily approach me and that i would be responsive and friendly with him but then got disappointed when i barely gave him any attention and told me to “smile”. I can’t believe where do these creeps get the confidence to do this? I also can’t imagine the danger underage girls must be going through by creepy men like this! Please stay safe girls!",

    "content": "My name is Seo-Yeon, I’m a college student who just loves to dance. I use dance as my way to escape, stress relief, or sometime help me concentrate. Growing up in a S.Korean family to immigrant parents has been tough on me because I’ve been expected to always bring home perfect grades, and being the youngest and the only daughter hasn’t made things easier, I’ve accustomed to having negative thoughts fairly often.\n\nHowever, ever since I’ve been young, I found dancing as my way to feel better about myself, and thankfully my parents have accepted it, at first they wanted me to compete and go big, but over the years, they’ve let go of their competitive nature. I don’t mean to give my life story, but it’ll make sense later. This happened to me like a year ago now so I still think about this pretty often.\n\nI live in a dorm at college, and because my college is big on online classes, some dorms are left vacant, even though they may be reserved by students who only come to class when needed so most cases would mean some students would have the dorm to themself. I was one of those lucky students to have a roommate who was sort of gone for most of each week.\n\nShe would sometimes come by about once a week, but only if she had class, or if she had an argument with her boyfriend who lived a few hours away. When she was at the dorm, she would talk about how her boyfriend is the greatest in the world, or how he’s the reason why global warming is a thing, basically she either loved him or hated him. I’ve never had a boyfriend so I can’t relate, but hearing situation often tells me that maybe it’s best I stay single. \n\nHer boyfriend came to the dorm every other time my roommate was there, I don’t really care to meet him, but he does try to make small talk, which I usually try to end the conversation politely because I often feel weird about a boy talking to me in dorm as it’s suppose to be my safe zone. All I really knew about him was that his name was Sean. Sometimes while I’m studying, I like to dance in my room, and because I grew up to Korean parents, I made it a habit of leaving my room door opened.\n\nWhenever Sean was around, I would sometimes catch him walking by my dorm, just to watch me dance, which I didn’t really care for, but it would always make me feel weird. The last straw was when I was in my dorm between classes and I was studying, I was listening to lectures on my laptop speaker while dancing cause it always helps me remember better. But then I heard Sean calling out to me and cheering me on. This frustrated me so much that I just took my things and stormed out, I didn’t want to make a scene, so I took what I needed and left for my class. \n\nAfter my class, it was late and I really anticipated going back to my dorm since I knew my roommate’s boyfriend would be there, so opt in to go to the 24hour library on campus. Even though this was almost 10 o’clock at night, the library had maybe a dozen students who can to study, relax, or even use the free wifi. I went to the far back as I could with an empty table to study and knew I probably would be here all night since my roommate’s boyfriend probably would have been at our dorm until the morning. So I got comfy and began to study for however long I could. \n\nWhen it was passed to midnight, I felt my conscious fading and knew I needed a celcius or redbull. So I got one from a vending machine that was all the way at the front, still seeing some students there studying, some even asleep on benches, looking like homeless people, which really got to me cause my parents would often threaten me that if I didn’t have good grades, I would be a homeless bum sleeping on the streets.\n\nAfter I got my redbull, I walked back to my table, looking back at the few students, when I noticed one of them starting at me. Even though it wasn’t super dark, the lights were dimmed, but the way his face was illuminated by his phone screen looked so creepy. He smiled at me and waved his arm, as if he knew me. I literally said “fuck that” to myself before speed walked back to my table. Once I got back to my table, which was behind some bookshelves and other things, I drank enough redbull to keep myself away, and as the caffeine kicked in, so did my stress, to which I knew I had to dance to calm myself, but also I was weirdly in the mood to dance too. So I put my AirPods in and began to dance to my hearts contempt.\n\nAfter dancing for probably close to twenty minutes, I sat back at the table, exhausted but wide awake,  and went right to studying, until I felt a tap on my shoulder.\n\nI freaked out, looking back to seem that same guy who waved at me. I felt such chills, like I was about to be murdered or kidnapped. I always grew up with protection, never felt like I was in danger, so when my fight of flight instincts were suppose to kick in, it just didn’t. I just sat there froze, staring at some guy I never seen before. The conversation went something like this. “Hey, are you Seo-Yeon?” “… yes… umm…” “I’m Jake’s Sean’s best friend” “oh!… nice to meet you.” “Sean told me you would need a buddy to take you back home?”\n\nI really don’t know how Sean would have known I would be at the library, I meant I suppose it’s probably the only place I would go, but I still didn’t get who this was or how he got into the library without an ID to scan himself in. I don’t meant to sound offense, but I’m in my early 20’s, my roommate is in her early 20’s, even Sean is like 20 something. This guy appeared be probably mid 30s. Why would this guy and Sean be best friends?\n\nI couldn’t think straight, I was trapped at this point, I don’t have the instincts to think of a way to get out of this, I wasn’t a fighter, and my heart was about to pop out of my chest, which probably was my biggest threat yet, fainting in front of a stranger. I wasn’t gonna fight it, I really had no idea what to do here because I knew if I tried to run, this guy could probably easily catch me since I’m working off of dying caffeine and adrenals that could put me in the ER.\n\nI accepted this guy’s offer, only because if I did want to make it home at this hour, I would have needed a buddy. After grabbing my things, Jake was kind enough to help me out of the library, but then I felt his arm wrap around my waist. I felt sick, like I just failed college, became homeless, and now I’m a prostitute just to make ends meet. I looked around with my eyes, seeing no one and assumed I didn’t stand a chance if I tried to run or scream for help, this guy could of had a knife or gun on him and could have killed me before anyone could save me. \n\nWe made it to my dorm, not even sure if I just guided us, or he knew the way. Honestly, all I remembered was feeling his fingers rubbing my waist, touching my skin like his nails were sharp and ready to just rip into me. \n\nI opened the door and thanked him so much, trying to make him leave, but then I seriously felt like puking when he grabbed my waist and pushed me inside while entering himself. I looked up at him with my eyes shaking so much that I couldn’t even focus, everything blurred and I immediately puked on his shirt. From here, all I remember was falling to the ground and seeing either static, or all black for a while. I couldn’t hear anything, and when my vision came back, I was laid down on my bed. I probably laid there for at least five minutes before Jake came back sitting next to me and feeling his hand rubbing my belly while rubbing my forehead.\n\nHe probably said something, but I couldn’t hear him. However, I started to noticed his hand was under my shirt, I felt as if I could puke again, but luckily my stomach was empty as my eyes began to shake again. I was frozen, I didn’t know what to do, I was too scared to do anything. I thought about screaming, pushing him away, trying to get to my phone to call the cops, but everything I thought of had a terrible outcome of him either knocking me out and doing stuff to me, or simply killing me. \n\nI couldn’t tell if Karma struck, but after a few minutes, Jake stopped rubbing my belly and was about to grab another part of me, but I suppose chose not to for whatever reason and just told me to get some rest before leaving. I think I laid there for half an hour before balling out tears and just crying as I felt so disgusting. I wanted to call my mom, but I knew she would disown me, I wanted to cry out for help, but everything I thought of had consequences in my head that would effect my life in the most negative way. Sean tried to talk to me, but I would do my best to avoid him.\n\nMy roommate eventually caught on to happened and sort of helped out by getting mad at Sean and telling him to tell Jake to rot in hell, which felt better, but I still felt like it wasn’t the right thing to due. I would often have nightmares of Jake rubbing me and telling me to please other clients as I was his worker. For the rest of the year, I stayed locked up in my room as much as possible. I only talked to my roommate, but as little as possible because I passively was still feeling that she should be partially blamed for having a boyfriend with creepy friends.\n\nA year later, I got some therapy to help me cope with my feelings, I’ve learned to speak up instead of dwelling in my thoughts, and I don’t get as many nightmares, but I still puke pretty often when I remember the feeling of his hands on my skin. I still haven’t told my mom about this, because I know she’s the type of person to tell me that I fucked myself up, or that I shouldn’t have done anything cause it could effect my chances of graduating somehow.",

    "content": "Hi everyone, this is my first post so I (22f) apologise if I’m all over the place with my text. \n\nI’m not sure if this really counts as a ‘creepy encounter’, but it’s been on my mind all day and I can’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. This happened to me last night - literally less than 24 hours ago - and I still feel uneasy walking past my own front window. \n\nI live in a small town in the north of the UK. It’s the kind of place where everyone more or less knows each other’s faces, and after about 8pm the streets are basically dead. I’d gone to the local shop just before closing to grab some milk. The air was very cold, that damp chill you get when the fogs starting to roll in. \n\nAnyways, when I came out of the shop I noticed a man standing by the cash machine. He wasn’t using it , just standing there with his hood up. I’m 5”1, and from what I remember he was a lot taller than me I’d say around six foot? I didn’t pay much attention to him and started walking home. A few minutes later, I realised he was walking behind me. \n\nAt first, it didn’t feel like anything. Same direction, maybe he lived nearby. But, I crossed the road at the roundabout and I felt the hairs on my neck go up immediately as I turned back around and noticed he crosssed too. Something felt strange, like he was deliberately mirroring my steps.\n\nI slowed down near a bus stop and pretended to check my phone, I expected him to pass me. He didn’t. He slowed down as well, keeping the same distance between us. No footsteps overtaking, no change in pace. \n\nBy the time I turned onto my street, I could feel my heartbeat in my throat. I didn’t want to make it obvious that I was scared so I kept walking as normal, but my hands were shaking so badly I could barely unlock my phone. My streets quite short , lined with terraced houses and the streetlights don’t reach all the way to the end. My house is in one of the darker spots. \n\nWhen I reached my door I just wanted to get straight in, I didn’t even look back. The second the lock clicked I slipped inside and went straight to the window beside the door. \n\nHe was there standing at the corner, not moving, just facing my direction. It’s like he was trying to see which house I went into. I stood frozen behind the curtain, he didn’t take out a phone, didn’t smoke, didn’t even look around- just stared. After maybe thirty seconds, he turned and walked off slowly, back the way we’d come. \n\nI didn’t see his face properly, the hood shadowed most of his face, but I could see the lower half- clean-shaven, possibly late 30s or early 40s. I just remember his dark coat and the sound of his shoes echoing on the pavement.  I didn’t call the police because I kept thinking maybe I was overreacting, but all day today I’ve had this feeling like someone’s been outside or is watching me. Maybe it’s paranoia, but I’ve never felt this kind of fear before. \n\nI don’t know what to do now. Has anyone ever had something like this happen to them- what did you do after? Should I inform the police? \n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo it’s probably nothing, but this morning I noticed fresh footprints right outside my door, like someone had been stood there facing it. I should mention it was raining on and off all day yesterday, so they must’ve been recent. I didn’t hear anyone knock or anything. A few people suggested getting a Ring camera so i’ve ordered one for a bit of peace of mind.",

    "content": "So I(M) and my male friend decided to head to Mount Shasta for the first time ,to see it's beauty and hoped to experience any creepy things while being there after hearing all of the legends about it.\n\nWe sadly didn't witness anything supernatural out there but loved it anyway.\n\nWe visited the towns near the mountain of Yreka and Weed and Mt. Shasta City ,and really enjoyed it.But we are both still creeped out after meeting a strange woman at a small diner in the town of Mt Shasta.\n\nSo we were both eating breakfast when I felt we were being watched by someone.I turned my head and met the gaze of a young woman sitting alone across from our table.\n\nShe is skinny with dark hair,light skin and seems to have lighter shaded brown eyes and is of medium height \n\nTrying not to be awkward,I smiled and waved to her and she returned the favor.That seemed to be an invitation for her to come walk up to us and start talking to us.\n\n\nShe introduced herself as \"Carmen\" and almost immediately started being flirty after barely having a normal greeting and first time conversation ,which made my friend and I feel a bit odd.\n\nHe is married and I am not ever into anyone that is alot younger then me(we are both in our early 30's and she appeared to be no older then 22)\n\nWe both played it off and tried our best to let her know without being rude.She eventually realized that neither one of us had any desire to flirt back with her and she got even more strange.\n\nShe looked at us both and proclaimed that we are obviously \"gay slurs\" before walking out of the door and leaving her table a mess.Im not sure if she dined and dashed tbh.\n\nMy friend and I both looked at each other and laughed after a bit of stunned silence.A few others that just have witnessed what had happened also laughed but seemed confused as well.\n\n\nWe are both from a pretty liberal area in the USA so hearing that from a total stranger kind of surprised us.But after researching a bit,the city of Mt.Shasta seems more liberal then the rest of the county it is in.\n\nWe finished eating at headed back to the parking lot,only to see \"Carmen\" pacing around the parking lot not far from our car.\n\nMy friend went to confront her,only got her to spot him,give a quick laugh and run off as fast as she could.\n\nWe checked our car for slashed tires or any other visable damage but there (thankfully) was none.\n\nWe decided to head back to the hotel after visiting a few local areas in the town .\n\nLater that night,I realized I had left an item in the car and left the room to get it...and I kid you not,that woman had found us .\n\nShe was standing on the other side of the parking lot directly across from me.\n\nI was now freaking out and yelled out to her asking her what her deal is.\n\nNow,believe me,I don't find myself to be very good looking at all but this woman did (or at least acted like it) she then laughed and said that a guy as \"hot as I am\" and that I need to just \"give in to what's natural\"\n\nI came to the conclusion that she was either simply a massive homophobe,or simply just crazy,maybe even on drugs even though she didn't look like she was.\n\nI told her to leave us the hell alone and that I will call the cops if she keeps messing with us and demanded to know how she even freaking found out where we were staying .\n\n\nShe laughed like a mad woman which really spooked me and I prepared to stand my ground if she tried anything crazy.But she simply then told me that she would love for me to come back to see her soon someday before turning around and walking off to who knows where.\n\nI then checked the car over again for the same reasons but there was no damage once again .\n\nI then hurried back to the room to tell my friend what had happened and we decided to just head out that night.\n\nWe told the guy at the front office that there was a strange woman littering around the area and saying weird things to us, and he offered to call the police .We decided against it and just wanted to get the hell out of there.\n\nWe even checked the back seat to make sure she had not somehow managed to get in.Hell,we still don't know how she found us so can you blame us for being paranoid?\n\nWe are both still weirded out by her pretty badly and I wouldn't even be surprised if she appeared outside of my home in a different state at this point \n\nWhat in the hell was up with her?",

    "content": "I've never posted on Reddit before, normally just lurking, but I feel like I need to share this, as it's something that has truly stuck with me for a long time.\n\nThis took place when I was around 8. For a bit of context, I grew up in a small  village where everyone knew everyone, and most of the time I was trusted to go where I wanted, which was the same for the majority of the children that lived in my village.\n\nIt was a summer day, and everything seemed normal. I was an active kid who hated being stuck inside, so I usually walked to the local shops. I was well-aware of stranger danger and always came straight home, never striking up conversations with strangers because I've always been shy, especially with new people.\n\nHowever, on this day, I had no choice but to talk to a stranger. As I walked back home, a car started following me slowly until it pulled up beside me, and the driver gestured for me to stop. I thought it was odd since I'd never seen the man or woman before, but I stopped anyway. He calmly asked for directions to the Hospital, which can be tricky to find for since it’s down a dead end.\n\nSince it could’ve been a medical emergency, I tried to give directions, but he didn’t let me finish before asking me to get in the car to show them the way. I refused, but he pleaded about five more times until I walked away. It wasn’t just the man's pleading that I remember; it was the woman who sat there expressionless, like a statue. and that's not even the main thing that stuck with me. It was the way she gave me an apologetic look as I walked away, and when I looked back, the car was still there, just watching me. I’ll never forget my mum’s face when I told her what happened. She seemed overwhelmed with terrible thoughts that no mother should have, and she’s been much more overprotective ever since.\n\nI hope that the intentions of the two strangers who pleaded with me to get in their car were good, but I will never forget the pure and utter fear I felt that day.",

    "content": "Sorry this is kinda long. Hi, I want to start this off by saying im a guy. Im 18yrs old and pretty small. Lets start with some background. Im only 5'7 and a little over 130pounds. I work as a waiter in a little dying chain restaurant. Most of the people I work with have some sort of a criminal record or a past with substance abuse. I'd like to say they're all good people though. We've been getting some new people that are from a halfway house of sorts, yet again, all nice people to me and everyone dispite what theyve done. \n\nAlright, so there's a new guy in the kitchen. Hes just got put into the halfway house and got the job as a cook in the back. I meet him in the morning when were opening on saturday. Hes 28yrs old, and probably 5'10 and some change, maybe 190lbs, im bad at guessing, just know hes bigger than me by a lot.\n\n Okay. Now I'm not off putt by many people however, maybe two hours of my shift I start to notice how much he stares at me, and how the way hes staring is different, very intense. I even text my friend to tell him about how  output I am by it. \n\nmaybe an hour after that a coworker of mine in the kitchen pulls me aside near the bar to tell me something. The new guy has said that he's in love with me. Wow. Okay.. she starts to go into more detail. When he was told I was 18 his response was a..  enthusiastic 'legal'. Okay! She starts telling me things that he's been saying in the kitchen, about how he's been going on about how beautiful I am, I'm officially freaked out. \n\nIm avoiding the kitchen like the plage now but maybe amd hour later the restaurant slows to almost a stop, no orders, no nothing. Now the kitchen is walking out of the back to walk around, get a drink of water maybe take a smoke break.\n\nI'm crouched down under a shelf by the bar the shelf holds all the cups that we have. It's kind of a bit above chest level, but I don't think that matters, I'm still crouched under, it being a bit from my head, talking to my friends and such. He comes out from behind the kitchen and walks up to me and gets too close to me standing and it's in such a way that I can't get up anymore and yes whenever I do that most people come up to me and say, 'oh! Ya hiding?'. But when he said it standing a foot or so away, right in front of me, his crotch eye level with me, yeah? A guys gonna fucking panic. \n\nI hit him with the,'oh i guess so.' And he just stays there. Lookibg at me, not saying anything. Someone walkes up to talk to him but he stays facing my way and chats it up. He doesnt leave. Not until hes called back to the kitchen, maybe stood there for a minute or two. And now he keeps getting as close as he can to me every second hes got nothing to do and im around and vaguely alone. \n\nAnd thats about all, besides the way he'll walk up, stare for an awkward amount of time, then say something about wokr going well in the back.\n\n I told my friends, most of them women or at least afab, and I kid you not, they stole my keys to hook pepper spray on there. Which, okay.. thats makes me feel a bit like a bitch but i know thats just the 'youve gotta be a manly man' bit of me speaking. In other wards, im a bit freaked. I've talked to a couple of people in there about this, the bartenders, and they've all backed me up. But I also know there's nothing I can do. I've only worked two other days with him tonight included, but he's still training so he was very busy tonight. \n\nThere are some other things that have bothered me but I feel like I'm looking way too deep into them now. At this point, I don't think I can do anything at all about this, which is fair, I mean, he hasn't really done anything. However, the fact that he was in prison for a bit and the way he's been around me, definitely makes me  feel.. like the pepper spray isnt gonna do much. I think this is why this is getting to me so much. I don't know.. thoughts?",

For whatever reason, there are 4 toothbrushes in the cabinet, and for whatever reason, I couldn't remember whiich is mine. There was a blue one, a green one, and two teal ones. I had a teal one that I took from my boyfriend's place bc after I slept at his I had a dentist appointment, but there were two teal ones, so obviously that didn't help. Somehow I just kinda woke up one day and had 0 recollection which toothbrush was mine! So I was forced to play toothbrush roulette, but I kept forgetting which one I used. I swear I didn't get hit over the head or anything, tho I am on new medication that has memory issues as their side effect - I was stuck in tooth brush purgatory. I couldn't just *ask* people which one they thought my brush was, and somehow all of them kind of looked used. The only recollection of a toothbrush I had was my bambus-wood-toothbrush, but I knew I had replaced that one with a pack of new ones. I knew I had *a* toothbrush, but I couldn't figure out which one was mine. \n\nToday, my mom slept over, and I finally just now built up the courage to ask.\n\nMy mom uses an electrical toothbrush. \n\nAll four are mine.\n\n....\n\nI'm such an idiot. \n\nTL;DR: I forgot which one was my toothbrush, tortured myself mentally for it for a month, turns out their all my toothbrush.",

So offcourse, I've been trying to be there for her as well. \n\nFriend #3 just called today. He just lost his father, so offcourse, I álso wanted to be there for him. But instead of saying \"Sorry for your loss. How terrible!\", i actually said \"Sorry for your loss. How annoying!\". \n\nANNOYING??? I ACTUALLY SAID ANNOYING???? O MY GOD I DID NOT MEAN THAT. I didnt even think it! I backtracked, said i didnt mean it, said i meant to say terrible.\nHe took it well. He just continued his story and i listened without making any more dumb mistakes.

    "content": "So this Halloween I decided to go all in.\n\nI had my pirate costume tailored, loaded up with every accessory imaginable - compass, locker key, pirate medallion, stacks of fake gold jewelry, even a hat with a built-in wig. I looked like I’d just stepped off the Black Pearl.\n\nThe only shortcut I took was the boots. Couldn’t find decent ones locally, so I ordered a pair online for about $40. They looked amazing… until about twelve hours later.\n\nI was having such a blast that I didn’t notice a thing - dancing, drinking, staggering through a few bars, then on to an after-party. But when I finally kicked those boots off… both my big toes were swollen like grapes. By the next morning, the nails had gone black and started throbbing like they were trying to signal for help.\n\nFast forward a week: I clipped them short, pressed down to relieve the pressure, got a lovely stream of bloody fluid, and today both nails finally came off completely. Painless, but now my toes look like they’ve been on a shipwreck.\n\nSo yeah - the costume was worth it, the pictures were fire, but the price was two toenails.\n\nTL;DR: Went all out on a pirate costume except for the $40 boots. Twelve hours of partying later, my toenails mutinied and jumped ship.\n\n*(Gross toe pics in comments - you’ve been warned.)*",

One second she was beside me, the next she wasn’t. I did a few fast laps around campus like a confused Roomba and kept moving until I spotted her: fully asleep inside a landscaping bush. Hair full of leaves. Out cold. I pulled her out, cleaned her up the best I could, and got us home like this was a normal Tuesday.\n\nThis morning we realized her keys were missing. I went back at sunrise and checked the same bush. The keys were dangling on a branch like a sad ornament.

    "content": "Well I’m writing this past 4 am because I’m so annoyed with myself and can’t sleep. I went out with a small group of friends for a good friends birthday today. We started with around 12 people and dwindled down to 6 at the last bar, and then 3 at the very end (me, the good friend, and a girl that was in the group who I wasn’t super familiar with). Me and the good friend were invited by the girl to go back to her place afterwards and indulge in a certain substance so we took her up on it. Keep in mind I have no previous knowledge that good friend and the girl have any kind of relationship at all at this point\n\nAll of us were getting pretty tired but we were periodically hitting it and talking so I was just enjoying the vibes. It wasn’t until about an hour and a half of what I figured was a good hangout that my friend says something along the lines of “well, it’s time for bed,” says he has to go to the bathroom, and goes inside. My first thought, of course, is “well I’ll wait for him so I can walk him home”. And then after going to the bathroom the two of them walk with me to the door and say good night. I couldn’t tell exactly if they were just super tired or visibly annoyed but either way it was clear that I was quickly being ushered out, which is when the “oh shit” moment happened and I put the pieces together. \n\nYou’re telling me I didn’t pick up on any cues after almost TWO HOURS? Right after I left I texted and apologized and told him to just ask me to leave if god forbid something that happens again but Jesus Christ I feel dull. Like yeah looking back on it no shit I overstayed my welcome. I’m not usually someone who struggles to pick up on social cues, and I especially don’t want to become one of those people. \n\nTL;DR- Went and chilled with a good friend and one of his girl-friends at her place after a birthday night out. Didn’t realize that I was third wheeling until I waited to walk him home and he didn’t leave with me. Worst homie ever 🤦‍♂️",

    "content": "So, I was just trying to “fix” my mosquito killer bat today. Nothing new. I’ve been tinkering with high-voltage, low voltage, literally any electronics stuff for about 10 years. Usually goes fine.\n\nThis time, the battery on the bat had gotten weak.  It couldn’t kill mosquitoes properly anymore. I figured I’d upgrade it by replacing the old low-capacity lead-acid battery with a Li-ion cell + TP4056 charging module (basically a modern rechargeable setup).\n\nEverything was going great. I opened the casing, removed the screws… and yeah, I was doing all this with the bat resting on my lap (rookie mistake #1).\n\nNow, for context:\nMosquito bats have a high-voltage capacitor that stores charge from a step-up circuit (the part that zaps the mosquito when it touches the grid). Even when the bat is “off,” that capacitor can still hold a deadly amount of charge.  hundreds of volts!\n\nTo be safe (or so I thought), I decided to discharge it manually. I grabbed a metal screwdriver and touched the mesh. Except I didn’t actually hit the terminals. Instead, I accidentally shorted the high-voltage mesh (the positive/“live” layer) while the outer mesh (the grounded layer) was resting on my thigh.\n\nInstantly. ZAP!\nA full jolt shot from my thigh up to my right middle finger. Not a tiny static shock — a real, sustained shock. Turns out, the power switch was stuck in the “on” position, so it kept discharging until I dropped the bat.\n\nIt was over in a second, but wow… that hurt.\nLesson learned: Recheck things.\n\nI’m fine now, and I kinda find this funny. \n\n\nTL;DR:Was going to upgrade batteries on a mosquito bat, but fucked up while discharging the high voltage capacitor.",

    "content": "TIFU and it actually happened a little while ago! I'm not a great story teller, but I'm going to try. \n\nMy grown son brought home some chili peppers grown in someone's garden a few days ago. I have little personal experience with them if they're not pickled in a jar, and all he said was \"they told me the small ones are jalapeños.\" \n\nLooking at them, and using my food network education, I thought to myself \"these small ones look like habaneros.\" Tiny, bell-shaped, and a pretty orange color. \"Let me taste a tiny piece of one before I put it in the potato hash I'm planning.\"\n\nSo yeah. I put a slice from the stem end in my mouth and crunched it up. Immediately after swallowing, I felt like my breath left me. The burn jumped up into my nose like that one time as a wayward child when I tried to use a disposable butane lighter to breathe fire and singed the bejesus out of my nose hair (the 1970s were crazy).\n\nMy lips felt like they were swelling, my nose was running, my throat was on fire, and I barely managed to call the aforementioned progeny to help after making the rookie mistake of slamming some ice water. He brought me our last 2 swallows of milk, and it helped. For literally 5 seconds. He brought me a Reeses peanut and butter and jelly cup (yeah. I don't understand the need for that to exist either). It helped a little  for a minute. \n\nThe only thing I could do is sit and quietly shudder and wipe my nose until it faded. I'm much too old to have had this experience today. 59 is old enough to know better. \n\nTL;DR: I taste tested a mystery chili pepper and it was bad.",

    "content": "Today I fucked up...\nFirst, I know it's against policy to pick up any animals during the job. I get that. However, there are people doing much worse things than me, and I was just trying to be a good human.\nAnyways, the story starts yesterday, but what I did was today. Yesterday, I was delivering mail, and the sweet old man, Mr. Henderson, came outside. I knew him well; he’d recently lost his wife of 53 years, and his sweet old retriever, Max, was his whole world now. He was teary-eyed and said Max had gotten out of the yard hours ago. He showed me a picture on his phone, a big, goofy golden retriever with a crooked smile. Since I'm a mail carrier, I see a lot of animals walking around. Of course, I kept my eye out for him. If I would see something, I would say something.\nThe next day, being today, I saw it. I saw a dog that fit the description in all its glory, this big, scruffy golden retriever poodle looking thing. He looked exhausted, like he'd been on a days-long adventure, but he was still clearly a domesticated pet. He came trotting up right to me, his tail giving a few weak wags, like I was his best friend. So, me being a good community helper, I picked up his leash (which was still attached to his collar) and walked him back to Mr. Henderson's house at the beginning of my relay.\nI rang the old man's doorbell, and he answered it through the ring camera (he can’t see well 😭), asking what was going on. I was so excited to tell him that I found his dog! Man, I was hyped. I was feeling like the coolest thing in the world. I was returning this man's dog that he was so distraught over, the last real connection he had to his late wife, probably. I just felt like such a bad bitch. That is, until he opened the door.\nHe all excitedly hobbled out and saw that this was not his Max. This dog didn't even look close to his Max, it looked like, in his eyes, just a big, muddy stray. Just then, Max walks up. He literally trots right up the driveway, comes to a stop next to his owner, and leans against his legs, panting happily. Then, the dog I was holding noticed the other dog on the ground. The dog in my hand started barking and pulling so hard on the leash that I nearly dropped it. He lunged and scared Max, who bolted right back down the street and out of sight.\nSo Mr. Henderson had his baby back for two seconds, and now he’s gone again, thanks to the aggressive stray I brought to his door. And I thought I was a hero, but instead, I am just a traumatizer.\n\nTL:DR I found a stray dog but thought it was the missing dog.",

The whole day yesterday I had nothing to do no one to hang out with it’s just been me and my car the whole day and around 5pm I went out with a friend to an Indian restaurant.  \n\nWell it really wasn’t good but that besides the point it was a 23 minute drive there and back and the whole time I was trying to make it back to my family who wanted to sing happy birthday but I ended up having to make a stop for ice cream upon my mothers request. \n\nAlso I will admit I stop to take photos of me and my car but I never usually take photos of my self but it literally took me less than 5 minutes. so I tried to be quick and I made it back around 8 and everyone was like already about to sleep so I was like we can sing it another time (we have done that before) and TL,DR:my parent were up pissed literally this morning like “oh we ain’t singing you happy birthday to you later today” and my dad was silently mad like I’m sorry i missed MY BIRTHDAY. I wasn’t that worried about it since i never thought it was that big of a deal personally.

    "content": "Hi all, obligatory not actually today due to uploading issues. This is my first post so please bear with me. I (32F) have this perfume I have loved for years. I got it from Hot Topic and I still have the same bottle that I had originally bought. It's an Alice in Wonderland type packaging/bottle and it was called Curiouser and Curiouser. I had NO idea perfumes can get discontinued because I'm not a heavy perfume wearer, only special occasions for the most part or if I'm feeling fancy that day. So imagine my surprise when the website said \"out of stock\" I just thought it was temporary... nope. I talked to my coworker and she informed me that scents can be discontinued for multiple reasons, just like her favorite perfume.\n\nI tried looking for it on the internet and found mostly private sellers asking over $200 or something crazy. I like the perfume but not that much. I think it was originally $5 but I dont remember. Either way that's way too much. I found this \"scent revival\" website that claimed they could recreate it with a great deal of accuracy for a reasonable price. \n\nI placed the order and waited for it to come in. Once it did, it came in a sizable bottle and I was excited. The problem was, IT SMELLED NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL. It was extremely floral and strong to the point I could taste it. The scent reminded me of something my grandmother would wear and I was so sad. If you like that sort of thing thats fine, just absolutely not something I could wear. It was so strong I could still kind of smell it the next day lingering on my arm. I hate returning things because its such a hassle sometimes so I wound up giving it to someone at work who liked it.\n\nSo back to square one. I decided to look around and found a private seller that wasn't asking for a ton and ordered it off of a resale website. You would think that would be the end of it but nope. Here's where I fucked up. \n\nWhile I was looking at websites before looking at private sellers, I found this website that I thought was marketing for a Joe Shmoe like me and could order a bottle. I found that they were selling the scent and I THOUGHT I was ordering a version of the scent in a body oil/essential oil for personal use. NOPE! I had forgotten I had ordered it because it took a while and my previous order from ebay came in and I was content. When the box came in with the company label on it I was so confused and then I remembered I had ordered the body/essential oil. The company sent me an email stating they had to pay extra for the shipping because they were having a hard time at the post office. I thought to myself, it probably has an alcohol base or something makes sense right? WRONG! IT WAS A MANUFACTURING BASE OIL TO MAKE THINGS WITH! There were so many handling instructions and storing instructions that I panicked and immediately put the container back into the box and emailed the company. I still haven't gotten a shipping label and I just want it out of my house. I joked with my coworkers saying \"it looks like uranium\" and when they saw a picture of the container they joked back saying \"the FBI will be knocking on my door\". \n\nFor clarification, some of the warnings on the container said: Do not expose to skin, do not inhale the fumes, wear proper PPE to handle, do not induce vomiting, call poison control if ingested, store in a ventilated area. The craziest part this whole thing was when I emailed the company for a return label they asked if I could just keep it. I said no absolutely not I dont care the return cost I just want it gone. They haven't gotten back to me so its still in my house. This whole thing took so long the company told me I didn't reach out to them within the return window and to keep it which is insane because I DID try and they never got back to me. \n\nSo TLDR: TIFU by trying to replace my perfume and got a container of hazardous material that the company asked if I could just keep it.",

    "content": "22F here, growing up my dad ran the house like a boot camp (he retired from the military when I was 6 and started living with us from then on). I'm not sure if it's because I once had a life without him around, but I could never get used to his presence or rules. He's made a monarch of himself in this household, a literal king. There is no backtalk or opinions, no nothing. I'd try to say literally anything and he’d lose it. Something common he sensed when he sees the slightest disapproval on my face was \"You don't put food on the table do you?\" \nPushing it too far is never an option because I discovered getting grounded is a thing through tv shows. We get beat up, verbally degraded and since my mother is another victim of his we had nothing to protect us. He never let me out of the house for my own interests and sometimes it's like he expected an apology for our existence. My mother tried to gaslight us into thinking it could be worse without him and my siblings just  learned to stay quiet (I can't imagine how he's fucked them up in their own story) and me I was certainly the one with the most resentment as the oldest but I just swallowed it and it's ruined my self image and it got to where i couldn’t even order food without second-guessing myself. It's affected my relationship with men permanently.\nHe tried everything to stop me from leaving the state for college but after a lot of nights of fights where I threatened to kill myself and he replied by saying \"be my guest\", he realized he hated me so much and I'm better off leaving his sight. College is the first place i ever had a peaceful breath. I've been talking to a counselor, unpacking all this crap. Turns out it’s not normal to flinch when someone raises their voice. Who knew. I fucking did. \nNow that we got the backstory down, I came back home this weekend. Sunday breakfast, my younger sister who's 16 was stressing about a school project at the living room sofa and my dad has this dumbass rule about how when everyone's at the table, everyone should be at the table. He condescendingly calls out her name and she says \"Just a sec\" and tries to quicken up. He does it again, and again. I try to make things feel normal and tell her \"Maybe ask for an extra day, yk it's ok if you explain it to the teacher” and dad slams his fork. “Shut up.” I freeze, the trauma of my childhood resurfaced after months of trying my best to fix myself and find peace. I then noticed how everyone just kept eating and ignored what happened because it's an attempt to make sure things don't escalate, something I was in on for so long and I couldn't believe he's making my little sisters go through as well. I'm not sure if that overprotective side won but the rage engulfed me slowly and I stared at him as my eyes filled with tears. He felt my stare but kept eating and when he realized I'm being serious he looked up at me and said \"wtf are you looking at?\" \nI just got up and tried to walk away and he got up and told me to stop and sit back down. I'm not sure what came over me, I just knew I never wanted to see this man again. When I didn't sit back he got up, which I'm assuming is to hit me. Something snapped in me. 20 years of shut up shut up shut up. I swung. caught him clean on the nose. He stumbled away cursing me to get out and never come back like i was a stranger. I went to my room scared and still full of adrenaline ready to get into another fight, packed my shit and peeled out. I know he's going to take out his anger on my family. I'm not ready to think about that right now. \ni know violence isn’t the answer but he put hands on me my entire childhood and this was just my delayed reaction. I'm still shaking thinking about it. \nTL;DR: Strict abusive dad shut me up for talking to my sister and I punched him in the face after years of being told to shut up.",

Over time, I started to like him a little more than just “friend.” It wasn’t deep “in love love,” but it was enough that I caught myself hoping for something.\nAnd honestly, I really thought he was giving me signals. Long talks, thoughtful attention, moments that felt a bit more than friendly. Maybe I was imagining it, maybe not but it felt real enough that I convinced myself to be honest.\nSo I told him. Quietly, sincerely, heart racing.\nHe was incredibly kind. He listened, thanked me for being open, and told me he cared about me deeply just not romantically. And weirdly, I wasn’t devastated. I wasn’t in love, so my heart didn’t break.\nWhat did break was my pride. The embarrassment hit instantly. Realizing I misread things made me want to hide under a blanket for at least a week.\nBut here’s the good part: we talked about it calmly. No drama, no tension.

But I’m also a little proud that I had the courage to be honest.\nSo yeah, I FU by confessing my feelings to a friend… but at least I didn’t lose him. Just need a few days for my ego to recover.\n\nTL;DR: I confessed my feelings to a friend I thought liked me back. He didn’t, but he was kind about it.

    "content": "Ever wonder what would happen if a struggling band documented their final tour during an alien invasion? I think about it daily. No, hourly!\n\nMostly because we’re making “Hello, Apocalypse”—a crowdfunded, micro-budget comedy-horror mockumentary where the end of the world has guitar solos, undead roadies, and questionable sci-fi logic.\n\nWe just wrapped Week 1 of our campaign and are 45% funded, with sneak peeks, new perks, and limited-edition rewards unlocked this week. If this sounds like your kind of weird, give us a look. Or roast us in the comments. Either way, we’re here for it.\n\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hello-apocalypse-a-comedy-horror-rockumentary/x/38178554#/",
